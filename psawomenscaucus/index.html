<H1>About the PSA Women's Caucus</H1>

<P>
The PSA Women's Caucus was founded in November, 2006 at the PSA meeting in
Vancouver, BC. The goals of the Caucus are to informally mentor women entering
the philosophy of science, to provide an opportunity for networking among the
women of the PSA, to raise the visibility of women in the field, and to address
any concerns about women and gender in the PSA.
</P>
