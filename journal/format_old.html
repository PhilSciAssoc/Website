      <h3><a name="format" id="format"></a>Formatting<br />
        </h3>
      <p>In order for an accepted paper to be published, the paper must conform to the conventions of <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html">The Chicago Manual of Style</a>. Below are  additional conventions used by <em>Philosophy of Science</em>. For anything not covered below, consult <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html">The Chicago Manual of Style</a>. The instructions below sometimes refer to sections in the 14th edition (abbreviated CMS).<br />
        </p>
      <p><em>Margins</em> should be ample, approximately 1-1/2&quot; (4 cm) top and bottom, 1-1/4&quot; (3 cm) left and 1&quot; (2.5 cm) right.<br />
        </p>
      <p><em>Justification</em>: Please do not justify text left and right. The right margin should be ragged.<br />
        </p>
      <p><em>Typeface</em>: Times or Times New Roman is best for proofreading and for computer translation. <br />
        </p>
      <p><em>Typesize</em>: 12 point. <strong>Type size should be full size at all times</strong>, including in footnotes, references, picture legends, etc.<br />
        </p>
      <p><em>Spacing</em>: <strong>All text should be double-spaced</strong>, including the text in footnotes, references, picture legends, etc.<br />
        </p>
      <p><em>Page numbers:</em> Please leave all headers and footers blank; in particular, please do not include page numbers in the header or footer.</p>
      <h3><a name="structure" id="structure"></a>Structure of Paper<br />
      </h3>
      <p>The final version of the paper should have the following parts, each beginning on a <strong>new page</strong><br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>abstract<br />
        </li>
        <li>main text<br />
        </li>
        <li>appendices [when necessary]<br />
        </li>
        <li>references<br />
      </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="abstract" id="abstract"></a>Abstract<br />
      </h3>
      <p>After the title page, start a new page. Place the abstract on its own page, with no label (i.e., the word 'Abstract' need not appear).<br />
      </p>
      <h3><a name="main" id="main"></a>Main Text<br />
      </h3>
      <p>The first section is numbered and normally titled &quot;1. Introduction.&quot; in boldface; subsections are in italics, and new sections in boldface again. Put a blank line between each section and subsection. Section titles use headline capitalization, for instance &quot;Explanation of Anomalies,&quot; not &quot;Explanation of anomalies.&quot; &quot;Section&quot; is capitalized when used as a proper noun, for instance &quot;as was proved in Section 1,&quot; but lowercase when used as a common noun, for instance &quot;as was proved in the first section.&quot; (Likewise for &quot;figure&quot; and &quot;table.&quot;)<br />
      </p>
      <h3><a name="italics" id="italics"></a>Italics and Boldface<br />
      </h3>
      <p>We do not italicize foreign or technical terms commonly used by philosophers of science. Examples:<br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>&quot;ipso facto,&quot; &quot;i.e.,&quot; &quot;ad hoc,&quot; &quot;a priori&quot; (not &quot;ipso facto,&quot; &quot;i.e.,&quot; &quot;ad hoc,&quot; &quot;a priori.&quot;) <br />
          Unfamiliar terms may be in italics. Examples: <br />
        </li>
        <li>&quot;The now obsolete Japanese term warifu was used to designate the tearing of pieces of material or paper … to record an economic transaction.&quot;<br />
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Indicate italicized words, phrases requiring emphasis, and titles of published books and journals by italic typeface, not underlining. Indicate boldface by bold typeface, not wavy underlining.<br />
      </p>
      <h3><a name="formulas" id="formulas"></a>Formulas, Equations, and Special Symbols<br />
      </h3>
      <p>Equations and symbols should be fully legible. Give any variables the style they should display, e.g., italics, bold, or unusual fonts.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Since setting type for bi-level and tri-level equations is very costly, all formulas and equations should be put in a form that helps to minimize the number of printed lines. For example: p = -dx/dy = -dz/dt.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Where you have an equation that might exceed a line length, make a note as to where the equation should be broken, or type it on the page as you wish it to be typeset and let the editors know to maintain that specific spacing and alignment.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Please type the equation as text (with any superscripts and subscripts) rather than in Microsoft Equation Editor. Complex material that cannot be done in Word should be carefully explained in a way that a typesetter who does not necessarily have detailed mathematical knowledge will understand.<br />
      </p>
      <p>When possible, an alternative symbol or sign should be provided if the symbol required is rare. To avoid confusion between similar symbols such as the letter O and zero, mu and u, subset and less than, clearly identify the symbol to the typesetter, for example, in a note to the typesetter at the beginning of the paper.<br />
      </p>
      <h3><a name="footnotes" id="footnotes"></a>Footnotes<br />
      </h3>
      <p>Footnotes should be used, not endnotes. The font should be the same size (12 point) as the main text.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Discursive footnotes should be avoided; incorporate material in the body of the text whenever possible. Remaining footnotes should be numbered consecutively throughout the typescript.<br />
      </p>
      <h3><a name="figures" id="figures"></a>Figures And Tables<br />
      </h3>
      <p>Figures and tables require special treatment. Please contact the editors if you have any questions.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Every figure and table should be produced in a large clean copy in a separate file. Please keep in mind that figures will generally be printed on a high quality printer, then photographed to produce the final output. A figure that looks good on your computer screen can easily turn out to look awful when printed in high resolution. The minimum resolution for graphics files should be 250 dpi for gray-scale art, and 600 dpi for line art. Please consult with local support if you are unsure how to produce high quality graphical images. The editorial office and University of Chicago cannot redraw images for you.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Tables should be typed with a minimum of borders and other features enabled. University of Chicago has a standard style for printing tables, and in general will use this style when printing your table.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Your images will be sent to us as separate files, but may also be included in the text at the appropriate place. Alternatively, you may indicate their approximate location with a note such as &quot;[Include Figure 1 here]&quot;. In either case, labels (&quot;Figure 1.&quot;) and any captions should be included in the text at the appropriate location. Figures within the text are centered, but captions are left-justified. Captions are punctuated and capitalized as sentences.<br />
      </p>
      <h3><a name="references" id="references"></a>References<br />
      </h3>
      <span class="pagecontent"><ul>
        <li><a href="#intext">In-Text Citations</a></li>

      <p>Authors are responsible for the completeness and accuracy of their bibliography and citations. Please cross-check your citations against your bibliography; our copyeditors and University of Chicago's typesetters often run across inconsistencies or incompleteness. In this case, you will be asked to fix the problem. This slows down production, and in the end saves you no time. Please go ahead and double-check your references now.<br />
      </p>
      <p>We use a variant of the author-date system. See the 14th edition of the Chicago Manual of Style chapter 16, but be sure to follow the specifications below. Be sure that the References include complete page numbers for all articles in journals and edited volumes. We prefer fully realized numbers, e.g. 123-127, not 123-7 or 123-27, both in-text and in the references section. In both the reference list and in-text citations, simply give the numbers, without &quot;page&quot; or &quot;pg.&quot;<br />
      </p>
      <p><em><a name="intext" id="intext"></a>In-Text Citations</em>: Simple citations or quotation attributions should be made by citation within the text, rather than by footnote. Cite author and year of publication, for example, (Jones 1974) and, when appropriate, page numbers (Jones 1974, 25). Note comma between year and page, but not between author and year. There is no &quot;p.&quot; or &quot;page&quot; preceding the page number.<br />
      </p>
      <p>If the context clearly specifies the reference, the year and page number are sufficient:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">Jones's theory (1974, 25) contradicts his earlier account (1965).<br />
      </p>
      <p>If the subject of the sentence is the author, then the citation is in parentheses, with a comma between date and page:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">Hegel (1787, 344) argued that ...</p>
      <p class="examplebullet"><br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">Hegel argued that ... philosophy (1787, 344).<br />
      </p>
      <p>If the book or article itself is what is being referred to, then there is no comma or parenthesis between author and date:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">This argument was refuted in Hegel 1787.</p>
      <p class="examplebullet"><br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">See Hegel 1789.<br />
      </p>
      <p>If in the latter examples you need to have page numbers, they are not put in parentheses:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">See Hegel 1789, 334-347.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Note that within the text, the period comes after the closing parenthesis of the citation.<br />
      </p>
      <p>At the end of a block extract, place the citation after the period.<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">No more causes of natural things should be admitted than are both true and sufficient to explain their phenomena. ... Therefore, the causes assigned to natural effects of the same kind must be, so far as possible, the same. (Newton 1999, 794-795)<br />
      </p>
      <p>When citing a reprint or translation, give the original year in brackets then the year for the new edition<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">... as argued by Duhem ([1906] 1954).<br />
      </p>
      <p>In places where you are referring to multiple texts by a single author, separate years with commas:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">(Marx 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986)<br />
      </p>
      <p>For many texts by multiple authors, use semicolons to separate authors:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">(Marx 1982; Eliot 1983; Fudd 1992; Duck 1993)</p>
      <p class="examplebullet"><br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">(Marx 1982, 1983; Fudd 1992, 1995; Fudd and Hare 1996; Duck 1999)<br />
      </p>
      <p>See CMS 16.14.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="list" id="list"></a>List of References</strong>: The bibliographical list of cited references must be headed REFERENCES and placed on a new page after the main text. List references alphabetically by senior author. More than one reference by the same author should be listed in chronological order.<br />
      </p>
      <p>If you know how to do hanging indents with your word processor, use them throughout the bibliography. If you do not, please format all references flush left, and leave an extra space after each entry.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Authors. Please use complete first and last names for authors, not just initials and surnames (if you cannot readily ascertain a first name, the initials will suffice). If there are two authors, use &quot;and&quot; not &quot;&amp;&quot;. Only for the senior author does the surname precede the given name. If the reference list has two works by the same author, use a 3-em dash &quot;–––&quot; in the place of the author’s name for the second work. For details about author names (including special cases), see CMS chapter 16.<br />
      </p>
      <p><a name="multiple" id="multiple"></a>For multiple authors, list the surname of the first author, comma, given name of first author, then given name before surname of subsequent authors, separated by commas with the word &quot;and&quot; before the last one. Even if there are only two authors, use a comma before the word &quot;and&quot;. Example:<br />
      </p>

      </p>
      <p><em><a name="titles" id="titles"></a>Titles</em>: For all titles of English-language works (articles, books, chapters, etc.) use headline (&quot;up&quot;) capitalization (CMS 7.127). For foreign book titles, see CMS section 15.118. Book and journal titles are italicized.<br />
      </p>
      <p><em><a name="books" id="books"></a>Books</em>: Include author or editor, space (no punctuation), date in parentheses, comma, title (including subtitle) italicized, comma, volume and edition, period, (translator and editor if in addition to author), city of publication (if needed: comma, state or country), colon, publisher, (if needed: comma, forthcoming), period.

      </p>
      <p><em><a name="translations" id="translations"></a>Translations and Reprints</em>: For a translated or reprinted edition of a book include author; open parenthesis, original date in brackets, new edition date, close parenthesis; title italicized; volume and edition; period, &quot;Reprint.&quot; (if applicable); translator, period; original title italicized; original place of publication, colon, and original publisher in parentheses; new edition's place of publication; colon; publisher, period.

      </p>
      <p>If you cite page numbers in the text, please make it clear in the reference list whether citations refer to the original or reprint/translation. For the capitalization of foreign book titles, see CMS section 15.118.<br />
      </p>
      <p><em><a name="technical" id="technical"></a>Technical Reports, Working Papers, and Similar Publications</em>: Include author, date in parentheses, title of work italicized, name and number of series, general editor(s) if a series, city, colon, publisher. Example:<br />

      </p>
      <p><em><a name="journal" id="journal"></a>Journal Articles</em>: Include author of article, space (no punctuation), date in parentheses, comma, title of article in quotation marks, comma, name of journal italicized (do not abbreviate journal titles), space, volume number not underlined, colon, space, page numbers. The title is treated as an entity, so the end quotes come before the comma separating the title from the journal name. Italicize the journal name, but not the volume and issue number. Example:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">Mayo, Deborah G. (1991), &quot;Novel Evidence and Severe Tests&quot;, Philosophy of Science 58: 523-552.<br />
      </p>
      <p>For book reviews, put the name and author of the reviewed book in parentheses after the title of the review.<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">Fodor, Jerry A. (1995), &quot;West Coast Fuzzy: Why We Don't Know How Brains Work&quot; (review of The Engine of Reason, the Seat of the Soul: A Philosophical Journey into the Brain by Paul M. Churchland), Times Literary Supplement 4821:5-6 [August 25].<br />
      </p>
      <p><em><a name="edited" id="edited"></a>Edited Volumes</em>: For articles in a book-length collection include author of article, date in parentheses, comma, title of article in quotation marks, comma, name of book's editor(s) (all surname last), followed by ‘(ed.)’, comma, title of collection italicized, period, place of publication, colon, publisher, page numbers, period.

      </p>
      <p>If you refer to many articles in the same edited volume, give the book its own entry in the reference list and use a short citation in the entries for the articles. Example:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">Feigl, Herbert, Grover Maxwell, and Michael Scriven (eds.) (1958), Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.</p>

      </p>
      <p><em><a name="psa" id="psa"></a>PSA Proceedings</em>: The Proceedings have appeared in several forms, which call for different styles of citation.<br />
        </p>
      <p>Through 1995 (PSA 1994 Symposia), the Proceedings were published as an edited volume and should be listed as such.</p>
      <p>1996-2002 (PSA 1996 Contributed Papers through PSA 2000 Symposia), the Proceedings were published as a Supplement to the journal Philosophy of Science. Example:<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">Keeley, Brian L. (2000), &quot;Neuroethology and the Philosophy of Cognitive Science&quot;, Philosophy of Science 67 (Proceedings): S404-S417.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Starting in 2003, the Proceedings are no longer a supplement, but rather a fifth issue of the journal. They should be cited in the same style as immediately above, except that the page numbers no longer include the letter S.<br />
