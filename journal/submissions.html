      <h2><a name="guidlines" id="guidlines"></a>Author Guidelines</h2>
      <p><em>Please read these guidelines carefully to help avoid delays with your manuscript.</em></p>
      <h3>Manuscripts</h3>
      <p>The submission should not have been previously published and should not be currently under review by another journal. Submissions should be double-spaced. The manuscript should include an abstract of approximately 100 words. A paper may not exceed 9,500 words, including abstract, footnotes, and references. </p>
      <p>Manuscripts must be prepared for blind review. Please see the section '<a href="#blinding">Blinding Your Paper</a>' on this page.</p>
      <p>All figures must be drawn and lettered with a professional appearance. All formulas and equations should be put in such a form as to help minimize the number of printed lines in the journal. See the section below on 'figures' for further important information about figures.</p>
      <p>The journal follows University of Chicago style guidelines. A bibliographical list of cited references (in alphabetical order) should be headed 'References'. Within this list, each reference should begin with the author's surname, given name, the year of publication in parentheses, followed by the rest of the information. In the text, simple citations or attributions should be made by supplying the author and year of publication, for example, 'Jones (1958) claims ...' or 'New evidence overturns this theory (Smith 1974, 46)'. Footnotes should not be used for simple citations. Discursive footnotes (consecutively numbered) should be kept to an absolute minimum. Review our<a href="../format.html"> formatting guidelines</a> to prepare your paper for publication. For further information on formatting, see  the <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html" target="_blank">Chicago Manual of Style</a>. When you submit your paper on the <em>Philosophy of Science</em> <a href="http://phos.edmgr.com">Editorial Manager</a> website, the paper will be built as an Adobe PDF which you must view and approve. When you view the file, make sure that it has all figures, illustrations, references, footnotes and the bibliography. The submission will only be forwarded to the editor after you have approved the submitted files. </p>
      <h3>File Format</h3>
      <p>Acceptable submission formats are determined by the <a href="http://phos.edmgr.com">Editorial Manger</a> software. <a href="http://phos.edmgr.com">Editorial Manager</a> must be able to build an Adobe PDF from your files. You will be required to preview and approve the built file before the submission is complete.</p>
      <p>Recommended file formats are Microsoft Word and TeX or LaTeX. If you are using TeX or LaTeX, please ensure that your source file can be compiled using only standard libraries.<br />
      </p>
      <h3>Figures and Illustrations<br />
      </h3>
      <p>We strongly prefer that graphics be incorporated into the main file wherever possible. If you send us figures in a separate file, please make sure that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is just one figure per file<br />
        </li>
        <li>It is very clear where the figures should be inserted into the text.<br />
        </li>
        <li>The figure is print-quality. Scans are not normally print-quality.<br />
        </li>
        <li>You have permission to use any figure that you have tken from another source<br />
        </li>
        <li>The file is in a standard, widely readable, format for graphical files---JPEG, GIF, EPS (Encapsulated Postscript), or TIFF.<br />
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="blinding" id="blinding"></a>Blinding Your Paper</h2>
      <p>Papers submitted to Philosophy of Science must be blinded prior to review. Papers cannot be reviewed unless they are properly blinded. To blind your paper, follow these guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no need for a title page. The first page of the paper should contain the title, immediately followed by the abstract, immediately followed by text of the paper. Your name should not appear on this page as the author.<br />
          </li>
        <li>Generic references to 'I' or 'me' (or other first-person pronouns) are permitted, unless they appear in conjunction with evidence that would lead the reader to infer to whom the pronoun refers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="examplehead">Acceptable: </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">&quot;In this paper, I will show that adaptationism is a grave sin.&quot;</p>
      <p class="examplebullet">        &quot;My argument in section 2 applies here as well.&quot;<br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplehead"><br />
        Not Acceptable: <br />
      </p>
      <p class="examplebullet">&bull; &quot;As I have argued elsewhere...&quot; <br />
      Correction: &quot;As Jones (2001) has argued...&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &bull; &quot;As I argue in (Jones 2001).&quot; <br />
      Correction: &quot;As Jones (2001) argues.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      &bull; &quot;This argument is fleshed out in my (2001).&quot; <br />
      Correction: &quot;Jones (2001) makes this argument in more detail.&quot;<br />
      <br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check that the paper has no running headers or footers with your name</li>
      </ul>
