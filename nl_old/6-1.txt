 1. NEH Summer Seminar for college and university teachers:
    PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY

Director: Alvin Goldman (goldman@u.arizona.edu)
Dates: June 26 - August 4, 2000  (6 weeks)
Location: Tucson, Arizona
Stipend: $3,700
Application Deadline:  March 1, 2000

This seminar will feature several components of special interest
to philosophers of science, and strongly welcomes applications
from philosophers of science.  Here are some of the topics
of primary interest:

BAYESIAN REASONING applied to testimony and other socially
produced evidence.  We will especially explore the ability of
Bayesian reasoning to promote increases in "truth-possession"
(in a sense to be defined).

SCIENCE STUDIES and the debates over scientific realism and
anti-realism.

The ECONOMIC ANALYSIS of a Market for Speech.
This would interest philosophers of social science.

TECHNOLOGY and its role in KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION.
 "Internet epistemology".

Social Dimensions of SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

"FORMAL" ANALYSIS of the Role of  Information in a Democracy.
This is another topic that could interest philosophers of social science.

For further information, see a description of the seminar available
on the following Web site:

http://w3.arizona.edu/~phil/nehsummerseminar.htm

Application materials are also available from that site.

(The Website description does not *highlight* the science-
related aspects of the seminar, because it is for general distribution.
But those aspects will be covered, and will be covered more
intensively as a function of the interests of the actual participants.)

 3. THE TESTING OF EVOLUTION IN KANSAS SCHOOLS.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science requested
that their constituent societies (which includes PSA) write letters of
protest to the Governor of Kansas regarding the State Board of
Education's decision to de-emphasize the testing (and thereby,
presumably, the teaching) of evolution and cosmology. After
discussion, the Officers of the Association composed and sent
the following message to the Governor. As of the present date
(1 Feb 00), the Governor has not seen fit to respond to our message.

George Gale
Executive Secretary

----------------------
The Honorable Bill Graves, Governor
State Capitol, 2nd Floor
Topeka, KS 66612

Dear Governor Graves:

The President and Governing Board of the Philosophy of Science
Association deplore the recent decision by the Kansas State Board
of Education to remove references to evolution and cosmology from
its state education standards and assessments. In our judgment, this
decision is likely to decrease the quality of education in Kansas in
three important ways.

First, the omission of important and well-established parts of
science from the curriculum directly affects the ability of future citizens
to understand questions that will affect the well-being of their families
and communities. In addition, the students of Kansas will not be given
our best answers to questions about the history of our species, the
history of life on our planet, and the history of the universe, questions
that are of concern to all thoughtful people. There is no more reason
to deny them these answers than to leave them with the belief that
the Earth is flat.

Second, by pretending that there are serious controversies in areas
where a massive body of evidence supports contemporary scientific
views, and insisting that this evidence should not be presented and
assessed, students are deprived of the opportunity for open critical
discussion. An educational system should foster habits of inquiry by
giving a fair account of the evidence for rival points of view, and by
showing how important questions can be resolved.

Third, by allowing the religious beliefs of a particular group to dictate
the form of the science curriculum, the recent decision gives notice
to those teaching in Kansas High Schools that they are not to be
allowed to impart what they know. They will also understand
that they are likely to encounter further pressure to conform to
the demands of a very specific faith. Under these circumstances,
it is probable that Kansas schools will fail to attract the most
thoughtful and dedicated teachers, so that Kansas students will
be further disadvantaged.

For these reasons we align ourselves with the AAAS resolution,
and urge that this ill-conceived decision be reconsidered.

Yours sincerely,

Richard Jeffrey, President
