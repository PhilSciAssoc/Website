1.&nbsp; <span lang="en-us">LETTER from Fred Kronz, Director of
</span>
the Science, Technology and Society Program at NSF.<span lang="en-us"><br>
</span>
<span style="color: black"><br>
<b>THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</b>:<br>
FUNDING FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE RESEARCH PROJECTS<br>
<br>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">The STS program is the primary 
supporter of research in philosophy of science and related areas (history of 
science and sociology of science) at NSF. Useful information about the program, 
proposal writing and submission, and the review process are provided below. 
Information about other NSF initiatives that may be of special interest to 
philosophers of science is also included.<br>
<br>
</span><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Modes of Support<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black"><br>
The STS program provides a number of distinct modes of support including 
doctoral dissertation research improvement grants, post-doctoral fellowships, 
professional development awards, scholar awards, standard grants, collaborative 
grants, small grants for training and research, and grants for workshops and 
conferences. For details, please see the Science and Society program 
solicitation:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf05588" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf05588</a>
<br>
<br>
The solicitation characterizes each mode of funding with regards to the activity 
supported (mainly research, though some have an education component and others 
allow for infrastructure development), eligibility requirements (some only 
require affiliation with a US institution and others permanent residency 
status), and budgetary guidelines.<br>
<br>
It is worth noting that a collaborative projects may have a substantial 
international component. In the proposal, the collaborator associated with a US 
academic institution must be designated as the PI (principle investigators) and 
the collaborator associated with a non-US academic institution may then be tied 
to a sub-award. For details, see the PAPPG (Proposal and Award Polices and 
Procedures Guide):<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf08_1/index.jsp" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf08_1/index.jsp</a></span><br>
<br>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">The PAPPG is new. It has updated 
guidance on fonts that may be used when preparing an NSF proposal and it 
includes revised language to the intellectual merit review criterion; the 
criterion now specifically includes evaluation of proposals for potentially 
transformative concepts. The term &quot;transformative&quot; is notoriously difficult to 
characterize&#151;a philosophical analysis of it would be most welcome. In the 
meantime, here is the key question that will be addressed in evaluating 
proposals as expressed in the PAPPG: </span><span style="color: black">To what 
extent does the proposed activity suggest and explore creative, original, or 
potentially transformative concepts?<br>
<br>
</span><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">New Program Solicitation<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">A new program solicitation is 
under review and should be published in February 2008. New caps have been 
proposed (subject to approval). The program hopes to increase many budgetary 
caps by at least 20% for most funding modes. If approved, the higher levels will 
be available for proposals submitted for the 1 August 2008 target date and 
beyond. The current caps have been fixed for several years; whereas, the STS 
budget has increased about 6% per year during that time, and the program's 
annual budget for 2007-2008 is $9.2 million and it is projected to double over 
the next ten years. Also, if approved, it will no longer be necessary to submit 
proposals to one of four component areas, though those areas will continue to be 
core areas of the program.<br>
<br>
</span><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Crafting the Proposal<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Prospective PIs should pay 
particular attention to putting together the project description and project 
summary of their proposals. An effective strategy for doing so is to use a 
successful proposal in your research area as a model. NSF cannot release 
proposals upon request since they are the intellectual property of the 
associated PIs, but you are welcome to contact a PI to request a copy of his or 
her proposal. To obtain information about STS awards, you may search NSF&apos;s 
Awards Web site:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch</a>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are several search modes. A particularly effective mode is by program 
element. The program element code is 1353 for history and philosophy of science, 
and it is 8815 for ethics and values in science. Each award entry includes the 
PI&apos;s name, the project title, and an abstract.<br>
<br>
Prospective PIs should us special care in addressing the two key criteria that 
NSF uses to evaluate proposals: intellectual merit and broader impact. These 
criteria are characterized in the program solicitation. The following 
supplementary document on broader impacts is also useful:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/gpg/broaderimpacts.pdf</a>
<br>
<br>
Finally, there are a number of common mistakes made in project descriptions that 
should be avoided. They include the following: failure to engage some key 
relevant literature, failure to map out a detailed plan of research, misplaced 
emphasis on background information over the proposed project, failure to explain 
how the results of the project will substantially contribute to the current 
literature or to the field, failure to explain how the results of the research 
will be disseminated, failure to characterize the intended audience or how the 
results of the research might impact teaching or the views of researchers in 
other areas. <br>
<br>
</span><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Proposal Submission<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">All proposals for the STS 
program must be submitted via FastLane:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fastlane.gov/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">http://www.fastlane.gov</a></span><br>
<br>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Prospective PIs, meaning those planning 
to submit a proposal to the STS program, are strongly encouraged to request the 
assistance of his or her academic institution&apos;s Sponsored Research Office. The 
SRO&apos;s grant experts are especially helpful in formulating budgets as well as in 
uploading proposal components via FastLane. It is best to contact the SRO for 
assistance at least several months prior to the target date for proposal 
submission.<br>
<br>
</span><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">The Review Process<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">For those not familiar with 
the review process at NSF, the following description of the STS program&apos;s review 
process should serve to dispel some of the mystery (though NSF does allow for 
substantial variation in the review process from one program to another). What 
follows is a sketch. A more detailed presentation is provided at the following 
Web site:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/meritreview/</a>
<br>
<br>
The STS program cycles twice a year, and each cycle centers on one of two annual 
target dates, 1 February and 1 August. The bulk of proposals submitted for a 
specified target date arrive at NSF during the two-week period immediately 
preceding that date, although proposals may be submitted up to six months prior. 
The &ldquo;hard&rdquo; deadline for proposals is understood to mean the target date, unless 
the PI requests an extension prior to the target date in which case the deadline 
is extended by one week.<br>
<br>
Over a three-day period about three months after the target date, the proposals 
are carefully discussed and then ranked by a panel of experts. Four categories 
are used: Must Fund, Should Fund, Could Fund, and Do Not Fund. Sub-rankings 
occur within each category except for the last. Prior to the panel meeting, a 
minimum of three reviewers evaluates each proposal. Two of those reviewers are 
panelists, and every effort made to match proposal topic with panelist 
expertise. The program also solicits a number of reviews from other experts on 
the proposal topic. The program sends out a minimum of three review 
solicitations for each proposal. <br>
<br>
Typically, the program recommends all Must Fund proposals and about half Should 
Fund proposals for funding. Within a month following the panel meeting, the 
program notifies most PIs by email about its recommendation intent, either to 
award or decline. The proposal reviews and panel summary are attached to the 
notification. If the intent is to decline, the PI may wish to revise and 
resubmit the proposal for the next target date. The panel summary rarely 
encourages a PI in the summary to revise and resubmit; when it does, that should 
be taken seriously. <br>
<br>
It takes the program about six months to put forth all award recommendations. 
After that recommendation is made, it takes another six weeks for it to make its 
way through the bureaucracy to the Division of Grants and Agreements, which 
makes the final decision and then issues funds. There is no guarantee implicit 
or otherwise that an award will be issued until the DGA makes that decision. 
However, once the program makes an award recommendation, it is quite rare for 
the DGA not to concur with that decision. Given the timeline indicated above, a 
reasonable start date for a grant submitted for seven months following the 
target date, though earlier target dates may be proposed since any research 
expenses covered by the grant that are incurred up to ninety days prior to 
receiving the grant may be charged to that grant.<br>
<br>
</span><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Other Funding Opportunities<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Finally, it is worth noting 
that there are some funding opportunities for philosophers of science at NSF 
outside of the STS program. The program SciSIP (Science of Science and 
Innovation Policy) funds research that aims to create new explanatory models and 
analytic tools designed to inform the nation&apos;s public and private sectors about 
the processes through which investments in science and engineering research are 
transformed into social and economic outcomes. Both disciplinary and 
interdisciplinary contributions are needed to meet the goals of the program and 
collaborative projects are encouraged. Although the SciSIP may seem to be 
targeted more towards social and economic sciences, some philosophical work 
would be pertinent. See the following Web site for more information:<br>

<br>
<br>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">The program EESE (Ethics 
Education in Science and Engineering) is primarily oriented towards proposals in 
graduate ethics education in science and engineering, but is also particularly 
interested in proposals addressing issues involving the international/global 
context and those addressing intellectual property issues, including scientific 
publishing. EESE supports three kinds of projects: Research projects, education 
projects, and combined research and education projects. For more information 
about this project, please contact Laurel Smith-Doerr at </span>

(703) 292-8543. Also, it would be very beneficial for institutions to involve 
their HPS and STS experts in the ADVANCE grants, which serve to advance the 
hiring, retention and promotion of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, 
and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Here is the link:<br>

<br>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">NSF also encourages broadening 
participation in science by under-represented groups.&nbsp; These include 
Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE), Faculty 
Early Career Development Awards (CAREER), Minority Postdoctoral Research 
Fellowships, and Career Advancement Awards for Minority Scientists and 
Engineers. Other initiatives are focused on specific research topics of 
potentially great importance. Information about all cross-cutting programs of 
NSF can be accessed at<br>

<br>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">The International Program encourages 
collaboration in all fields of science between American scholars and other 
scholars throughout the world.&nbsp; Funding is often available for travel aimed at 
developing such connections at all levels, from graduate students to senior 
scholars.&nbsp; INT is especially interested in supporting postdoctoral exchanges, 
and support exists for organizing conferences to open exchange. Research 
collaborations also are supported.&nbsp; INT is especially eager to expand 
connections to the less developed nations, particularly in Africa. STS scholars 
can obtain INT funding to supplement a regular award, or can apply directly to 
INT.&nbsp; For more information, see the INT web page, especially the announcement 
International Opportunities for Scientists and Engineers, NSF 00-138:<br>

<br>
<b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Peer Review<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">The STS Program (and NSF more 
generally) depends on its community of scholars to serve as reviewers. The 
program cannot make solid, responsible funding decisions without the guidance of 
experts in its core fields of research. If you are asked to serve as a reviewer 
on a proposal, please help us out by agreeing to do so and please be sure to 
submit your review in a timely manner. Less than half the scholars who are asked 
serve as reviewers agree to do so. The process may seem rather impersonal, 
nevertheless please realize that your efforts are truly appreciated. I surely do 
appreciate it, as do my fellow program officers, Laurel Smith-Doerr and Steve 
Zehr.<br>
<br>
</span><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Closing Remarks<br>
<br>
</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">Members of the philosophy of 
science community are strongly encourage to submit proposals to the STS program. 
Now is a really good time to do so. The number of submissions has been rather 
low during the last three cycles, the STS budget is growing and will continue to 
do so for the foreseeable future, and funding levels will soon be going up.<br>
<br>
If you are uncertain as to whether your project is suitable for the STS program, 
you are welcome to send a query to
<a href="mailto:fkronz@nsf.gov" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
fkronz@nsf.gov</a> that includes a project summary as an attachment. The summary 
should be no more than one page&#151;single spacing is okay as long as a reasonable 
font is used. It should provide pertinent background and a concise description 
of the research activity that would be supported by the grant, and please 
include your name on the one-pager.<br>
<br>
Finally, if you have any ideas as to how the STS program could better serve the 
philosophy of science community, then please send your suggestions to
<a href="mailto:fkronz@nsf.gov" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
fkronz@nsf.gov</a>. STS program officers will discuss it and then one of us will

6. CONFERENCE: Theoretical Frameworks and Empirical Underdetermination Workshop,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April 10-12 2008, University of D&uuml;sseldorf.<br>
<br>
The aim of the workshop is to explore new and fruitful avenues concerning the 
empirical limits of scientific knowledge. It brings together some of the world&apos;s 
leading experts in the scientific realism debate to discuss the latest 
developments in the field. Topics to be discussed include structural realism, 
underdetermination, empirical equivalence, the pessimistic meta-induction 
argument, the reference of scientific terms and inference to the best 
explanation.<br>
<br>
The programme will commence with a eulogy to the late Peter Lipton, who was 
originally scheduled to give a talk at the workshop. David Papineau who had 
known Peter for over twenty years will give the eulogy.<br>
<br>
Attendance is open to all but please RSVP Ioannis Votsis -
