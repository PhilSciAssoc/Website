   1. Wesley C. Salmon

  (Editor's note: This obituary was written by Adolf Grünbaum, the Andrew
  Mellon Professor of Philosophy of Science at Pitt.)

  On Sunday, April 22, 2001, Wesley C. Salmon, University Professor Emeritus
  of philosophy, and professor emeritus of the history and philosophy of
  science at the University, was killed instantly in an automobile accident.

  His wife, Merrilee Salmon, Pitt professor emerita of the history and
  philosophy of science, and of anthropology, was in the vehicle with him but
  survived uninjured.

  An eminent, internationally renowned philosopher of science, Wesley Salmon
  was a much beloved colleague, teacher and friend whose premature death is a
  grievous loss to the local, national and international academic community.

  Born in 1925, he earned his doctorate at the University of California, Los
  Angeles, in 1950 under Hans Reichenbach, one of the towering figures of
  20th-century philosophy of science, whose collection is part of the Archives
  of Scientific Philosophy at the University's Hillman Library.

  He held appointments at several universities before serving as Norwood
  Russell Hanson Professor in the Department of History and Philosophy of
  Science at Indiana University (Bloomington) from 1963 to 1973. He was at the
  University of Arizona (Tucson) from 1973 to 1981.

  Salmon joined the Pitt faculty in 1981 as professor and chairman of
  philosophy, professor of history and philosophy of science, as well as
  resident fellow in the Center for Philosophy of Science. From 1983 until his
  retirement in 1999, he held the rank of University Professor of Philosophy,
  filling the post in which Carl G. Hempel, a major figure in 20th-century
  philosophy of science, had preceded him.

  His visiting professorships include appointments at the Minnesota Center for
  Philosophy of Science at the University of Minnesota (1963 and fall 1985),
  the University of Pittsburgh (1968-1969), the University of Melbourne,
  Australia (1978), and at the University of Konstanz, Germany (1995-1996).
  His last visiting appointment was in 2000 at Kyoto University in Japan,
  where Merrilee Salmon had a like appointment.

  After giving a series of four lectures in 1988 on "Four Decades of
  Scientific Explanation" at the University of Bologna in Italy, on the
  occasion of its 900th anniversary, Salmon acquired mastery of Italian by
  taking courses at Pitt, and subsequently gave professional lectures in that
  language at several universities in Italy. To honor the work of both
  Merrilee and Wesley Salmon, the Florentine Center for History and Philosophy
  of Science hosted a workshop on "Experience, Reality, and Scientific
  Explanation" in May 1996.

  Wesley Salmon's books and articles have ranged broadly over the theory of
  scientific explanation, causality, probability, scientific confirmation and
  induction, and the philosophy of physical science. After Hempel's pioneering
  models of scientific explanation, which featured the expectability of
  phenomena, Salmon developed influential rival models abjuring expectability
  in favor of providing causally relevant factors.

  His well-known books include "The Foundations of Scientific Inference"
  (1967), "Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World"
  (1984), "Four Decades of Scientific Explanation" (1990), and "Causality and
  Explanation" (1998), a collection of essays spanning several decades. He was
  also the editor or co-editor of five volumes.

  Recently, he was working on a pedagogical book (with Pitt faculty member
  Dennis Looney) on Italian science from Dante to Fermi, based on a unique
  interdisciplinary Pitt honors course that they had co-taught. He also was
  well along toward completing another collection of his essays, entitled
  "Reality and Rationality."

  Salmon's career was distinguished by the high professional offices he held,
  the fellowships in learned societies to which he was elected, and by an
  array of other academic recognitions.  They include the presidencies of the
  American Philosophical Association (Pacific Division, 1977-78), the
  Philosophy of Science Association (1971-72), the International Union of
  History and Philosophy of Science (1998-1999), and its Division of Logic,
  Methodology and Philosophy of Science (1996-99). He was a fellow of the
  American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Association for
  the Advancement of Science.

  Salmon's contributions were recognized by two Festschrift books in his
  honor:  the inaugural volume of the series "Australasian Studies in the
  History and Philosophy of Science," entitled "What? Where? When? Why?,
  Essays on Induction, Space and Time, Explanation" (1982, edited by Robert
  McLaughlin), followed by "Probability and Causality: Essays in Honor of
  Wesley Salmon" (1988, edited by James Fetzer).

  Besides earning a Humboldt Foundation Award for 1995-1996, he had received a
  Ford Foundation Faculty Fellowship (1953-54), a Creative Teaching Award from
  the University of Arizona (1977), and a University of Pittsburgh President's
  Distinguished Research Award (1990), in addition to a number of Research
  Grants from the National Science Foundation.

  His service to the profession was marked by membership of national and
  international committees, and of the editorial boards of a number of
  journals.  Furthermore, he served on several major committees at Pitt.

  Besides his wife Merrilee Salmon, he is survived by a daughter, Victoria
  (Tori) Gardner of Bloomington, Indiana; a stepdaughter, Charlotte Broome of
  Pittsburgh; a stepson, Bruce Ashby of Reston, Virginia, and five
  grandchildren.

  Burial was private, and the family requests that no flowers be sent. A
  memorial fund for graduate education in the philosophy of science is being
  established in Salmon's memory. Contributions should be made payable to the
  University of Pittsburgh, specifying the Wesley C. Salmon Memorial Fund, and
  sent to 1017 Cathedral of Learning.

  A memorial service will be announced at a later date.

   2. PSA 2002: Call for Symposium Proposals and Workshop Proposals.

  Philosophy of Science Association Eighteenth-Biennial Meeting, 7-10 November
  2002 Milwaukee, Wisconsin

  Philosophy of Science Association
  Eighteenth-Biennial Meeting, 7-10 November 2002 Milwaukee, Wisconsin

  Members of the PSA are invited to submit proposals for symposia and
  workshops to be presented at the PSA 2002 meeting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
  November 7-10. Proposals must include sufficient supporting material to
  permit the program committee to evaluate the quality and interest of the
  symposium or workshop. The proposal should include:

  1. The title of the proposed symposium or workshop.
  2. A description of the topic and a justification of its current importance
  to the discipline (about one or two pages).
  3. Titles and abstracts of papers.
  4. A list of participants and either an abbreviated curriculum vitae or
  short biographical information file for each.
  5. Addresses of each participant, with the institutional affiliation, postal
  and email addresses, and telephone numbers.

  Please indicate clearly the name of the organizer or contact person for the
  purposes of communication with the Program Committee.

  In addition to inviting proposals in traditional areas of the philosophy of
  science, the Program Committee wants also to encourage the submission of
  proposals that involve participation of working scientists.

  New Format
  This year there are two changes to note:
  · New type of session - the workshop;
  · Web archiving of papers prior to meeting.

  In addition to invited symposia sessions and contributed papers sessions,
  PSA 2002 will feature workshops.  The symposia will follow the traditional
  format, whereby the papers presented will be submitted for consideration to
  be published after the meeting in a supplementary issue of Philosophy of
  Science.  The evaluation for publication will be on entire sessions, that
  is, all papers in the session will be published together.  All papers
  presented at PSA2002 will be electronically archived, including those
  accepted for publication and those not accepted for publication in the
  Journal.

  Workshops will follow a new format, whereby there is no expectation that the
  papers presented will be submitted for review for publication.  Authors may
  choose to have them archived in electronic form.  This format may be more
  attractive to sessions involving participants from outside the philosophical
  community.  For example, informational sessions on new developments in an
  area of science or an area of philosophy of science may want to adopt the
  workshop model.

  We are going totally electronic for this meeting.  That means that the
  abstracts for the symposia and workshops will be available on-line prior to
  the meeting.  If participants in symposia or workshops would like to make
  the texts of their presentations available on-line, we will also publish
  them at the web site. It also means that all submissions must be sent by
  email as attachments or uploaded at our interactive web site.

  UNTIL 15 JUNE 2001 Submissions are to be sent by email as attachments in
  Portable Document Format (pdf), PostScript (ps), Plain Text (ASCII) Word
  (doc) or HTML (html) to the following address: psa2002@pitt.edu.
  AFTER 15 JUNE 2001 Submissions may be sent EITHER by email as described
  above OR by means of an interactive web site at www.pitt.edu/~psa2002

  Symposium proposals should reach the chair of the Program Committee no later
  than
  1 NOVEMBER 2001.
