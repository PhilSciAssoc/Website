 1. HISTORY OF PHYSICS NEWSLETTER

The Forum on History of Physics of the American Physical Society
(APS) publishes twice each year the History of Physics Newsletter with
information about history of physics activities in APS, book reviews,
upcoming meetings, and other news related to the history and philosophy of
physics. In order to increase interaction among those interested in the
history and philosophy of physics, the Forum invites members of groups with
related interests (e.g. PSA, HSS, ...) to receive copies of the Newsletter
and to contribute to its pages. Those wishing to receive History of Physics
Newsletter should write or email Prof. Bill Evenson (Editor), Department of
Physics and Astronomy, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602-4645,
evenson@byu.edu. The Forum on History of Physics has about 3,000 members,
including both historians or philosophers of physics and practicing
physicists with an interest in history.

 3. Call for Papers: Model-Based Reasoning (Deadline VERY SOON! Nov. 30,
2000)

                        MODEL-BASED REASONING:

   Scientific Discovery, Technological Innovation, Values (MBR'01),

                  Pavia, Italy, May 17-19, 2001.

         Up-to date information on the conference will be found at
             http://philos.unipv.it/courses/progra1.html

The conference will deal with the logical, epistemological, and
cognitive aspects of modeling practices employed in scientific
discovery and technological innovation, including computational
models of such practices. Papers are solicited that examine various
forms of model-based reasoning, such as analogical and visual
modeling, from philosophical, historical, sociological, psychological,
or computational perspectives. We also plan to address the problem
of model-based reasoning in ethics reasoning, especially pertaining
to science and technology.

Authors must submit three printed copies and an electronic version
- formatted in Microsoft Word, RTF, PDF, or Postcript format -
of an extended abstract (about 1000 words) not later than
