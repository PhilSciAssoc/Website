2.<span lang="en-us"> IN MEMORIAM:&nbsp; Ellery Eells (1953 - 2006).&nbsp; 
Dearly missed by those who knew him well. </span><br>
<br>
<span lang="en-us">Ellery Eells gained major recognition from his book, <i>
Rational Decision and Causality</i> (Cambridge University Press) in 1982, after 
graduating with a PhD in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley, 
in 1980.&nbsp; The book was published at the height of the 
uproar about Newcomb-style counterexamples to Bayesian decision 
theory.&nbsp; In it, he developed the novel position that Bayesian decision 
theory can produce the same answers as the new causal decision theory if 
deliberation is viewed as a dynamical process.&nbsp; Besides spear-heading this new line of 
research in decision theory, his work rekindled interest in old questions about 
the relationship between causality and probability.&nbsp; In 1991, he published 
a major work on <i>Probabilistic Causality</i>, which won the 
American Philosophical Association's Franklin J. Matchette Prize in 1995.&nbsp; 
In the meantime he was publishing papers in a third area, confirmation 
theory.&nbsp; His best known paper in this area is &quot;Problems of Old 
Evidence&quot;, which was originally published in the <i>Pacific 
Philosophical Quarterly </i>in 1985.&nbsp; It has been reprinted twice since then.<br>
<br>
After holding a one year visiting position at North Carolina State University, 
Ellery moved to the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison in 1981, where he received tenure in 1985, and was promoted to 
full Professor in 1990. He never left Madison.<br>
<br>
This year he was a returning member of the Governing Board of the PSA.&nbsp; He has 
always been tireless in his service to the philosophy of science community, 
especially behind the scenes.&nbsp; For example, he normally wrote more than ten reviews and referee 
reports per year.<br>
<br>
To those who knew him personally, Ellery was a kind and gentle person with a 
quiet, but cheerful, demeanor.&nbsp; Academically, had an unparalleled patience for details, which 
shows up very clearly in his published work.&nbsp; (He once told me that he had 
never had a paper rejected for publication!)&nbsp; His patience made him popular 
amongst the graduate students and colleagues who sought his expertise, 
and equally amongst those who were novices in his field.&nbsp; Ellery was the 
person with whom you'd want to share committee work as well; he was hard-working 
and reliable, and would always have copious notes.&nbsp; When serving on the 
admissions committee, for instance, Ellery was always able to summarize the best 
points of every candidate.&nbsp; He was always looking for the good in people.<br>
<br>
Ellery fell into a coma during the night of August 4, 2006, after being 
hospitalized the day before, and died five days later.&nbsp; He is survived by 
his wife, </span>Joanne Tillinghast<span lang="en-us">, son Justin and daughter 
Erica.&nbsp; Anyone interested in sending a sympathy card can write to </span>
Joanne Tillinghast<span lang="en-us">, </span>13 Backbay Circle<span lang="en-us">,
</span>Madison, WI 53717<span lang="en-us">.&nbsp; There will be a memorial 
session for Ellery Eells at the Pacific APA meetings, San Francisco, April 2007.<br>

<br>
What distinguishes science from all other human endeavours is that the accounts 
of the world that our best, mature sciences deliver are strongly supported by 
evidence and this evidence gives us the strongest reason to believe them. While 
this is the distinctive mark of science, unanimity has still to emerge among 
philosophers of science about the logic of confirmation and induction used to 
relate evidence to science. The state of these logics stands in stark contrast 
to that of deductive logic, where there is essentially no dispute over which are 
the good systems of deductive logic. Opinions on confirmation and induction 
diverge wildly in philosophy of science. At one extreme are those such as the 
Bayesians or learning theorists, who believe that the true system of inductive 
logic has been found and all that needs to be resolved are the details. At the 
other are skeptics, such as some supporters of the underdetermination thesis, 
who hold that no logic can vindicate the level of support scientists claim for 
their best, mature theories, for, they urge, the real inductive import of 
evidence cannot be that decisive. Between these extreme are many intermediate 
positions, including the view that the very nature of inductive inference 
remains poorly understood.<br>
<br>
Our goal in this conference is to bring together representatives from as many of 
these viewpoints as possible in order to advance our understanding of this 
problem. The conference will encourage contributions from philosophers of 
science with both systematic and critical perspectives as well as papers that 
develop revealing case studies in science.<br>
<br>
The conference is generously supported by the Centre for Philosophy of Science,

<br>
The general philosophical theme of this meeting will be that of why and how 
philosophers and historians of mathematics need each other. This takes for 
granted the thesis, ventilated by Lakatos, that they do so. One is here 
referring, of course, to his famous paraphrase of Kantian dictum: &quot;The history 
of mathematics, lacking the guidance of philosophy, has become blind, while the 
philosophy of mathematics, turning its back on the most intriguing phenomena in 
the history of mathematics, has become empty&quot;.<br>
<br>
Any serious attempt of remedying this, and thus approaching the history and 
philosophy of mathematics, will either &quot;bring to&quot; philosophy the historian's 
expertise of conducting meticulous diachronical case-studies, or else &quot;bring to&quot; 
history the philosopher's concern with epistemological depth; preferably both. 
Moreover, a focus on the historical dimension of mathematical practices is not 
to the exclusion of contemporary themes. To the contrary: Lakatos's point 
pertains to the historicity or growth of mathematical knowledge, past and 
present. <br>

<br>
James Madison College of Michigan State University seeks candidates for a 
tenure-stream position in political theory and science and technology policy. 
The appointment is at the Assistant Professor level and begins August 2007. 
Candidates should be broadly trained in political philosophy and their scholarly 
work should focus on the nature, origins, development, and future of science and 
technology as well as its ability to inform current ethical, political, or 
institutional dimensions of science and technology policy. Specific subjects of 
interest could include but are in no way limited to: biomedicine, public health, 
sustainable development or sustainability science, information technology, 
evolutionary ethics, comparative national styles of science, and gender and 
science. The successful candidate will contribute to a established major in 
political theory as well as a new program in science, technology and public 
policy.<br>
<br>
James Madison College provides a liberal education in public affairs, combining 
the ethos of a small liberal arts college with the advantages of a large, 
diverse research university. The faculty’s primary mission is excellence in 
undergraduate teaching and the College is noted for its rigorous academic 
standards and attention to the analytical, writing and speaking skills of its 
students. The College is home to three multi-disciplinary majors: International 
Relations, Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy, and Social Relations, 
as well as specializations in Muslim Studies; Western European Studies; 
Political Economy; and Science, Technology, Environment and Public Policy [STEPPS].
<br>
<br>
Applicants should supply a statement, addressing how their research and teaching 
interests would contribute to the College’s resources in political theory and to 
the Science, Technology, Environment, and Public Policy Specialization as well 
as to a college curriculum focused on public affairs. Supporting materials 
should include a vita, transcript, three confidential letters of recommendation 
that speak to teaching expertise and scholarly promise, and a sample of 
scholarship such as a dissertation chapter, article, or conference paper. 
Minority and women candidates are strongly encouraged to apply. All materials
