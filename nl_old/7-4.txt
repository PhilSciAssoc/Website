3. Call for Papers, 20th Annual Mephistos Conference, Graduate Program
in Science and Technology Studies, Virginia Tech:  March 14-17, 2002.

Deadline for submissions: January 7, 2002

Each year the Mephistos graduate student conference moves to a new
location, and this year, the STS program at Virginia Tech is proud to
host the 20th anniversary event. Mephistos is a multi-disciplinary
graduate student conference in the History, Philosophy, Sociology, and
Politics of Science, Technology, and Medicine (sometimes known as
"science studies"). The conference offers an opportunity for graduate
students to present papers, engage in formal and informal discussion,
and meet students from other universities who share their research
interests.

The Mephistos 2002 Organizing Committee welcomes submissions to present
current research, a dissertation chapter, thesis or dissertation
proposals, or other unique forums for interaction. We seek submissions
of abstracts from graduate students in any discipline or
interdisciplinary program on any topic whose research analyzes issues in
(or related to) science, technology, and medicine. Papers may range
chronologically from ancient times to the present. Please mail, e-mail,
or fax a one-page abstract (e-mail submissions preferred) for a 15-20
minute paper and a brief C.V. by January 7, 2001 to:

Mephistos 2002, Graduate Program in Science and Technology Studies,
Virginia Tech, 131 Lane Hall, Blacksburg, VA 24061-0227.
Tel.: (540) 231-6547
FAX: (540) 231-7013
E-mail: meph2002@vt.edu

NOTE: We plan to offer travel grants to all students who participate in
the conference. As such, we encourage early submission of abstracts and
proposals so that our funding committee can more effectively procure the
necessary funds. Thus, we will begin accepting submissions on December
10, 2001.

4. Call for Papers, Fourth Annual St. Louis Philosophy of Social Science
Roundtable, to be held March 15-17, 2002, ST. LOUIS UNIVERSITY.

This meeting will build on the first three roundtable conferences held
at St. Louis University (April 1999), University Missouri-St. Louis
(March 2000), and Washington University (April 2001); it continues a
tradition of meetings that bring together philosophers and social
scientists of diverse backgrounds to discuss a wide range of
philosophical issues raised in and by social research.

This year Steven Lukes (London School of Economics) and Russell Hardin
(New York University) will give keynote addresses.

Abstracts on any topic in philosophy of the social sciences are welcome.
We plan to assemble a two-day program of papers to be presented in
workshop format so that intensive discussion can be the focus of the
meeting.  We will choose papers with the aim of ensuring a broad mix of
topics and of presenters from diverse disciplinary backgrounds; we
particularly welcome contributions from junior colleagues and colleagues
new to the area. In this spirit, we have established an alternate year
policy for regular participants; in general, we will give preference to
new contributors over those who presented papers at the previous year's
Roundtable. Selected papers from the Roundtable will be published in an
annual special issue of Philosophy of the Social Sciences (see the March
2000 and 2001 issues of Philosophy of the Social Sciences for papers
from the 1999 and 2000 St. Louis Roundtables).

Send a ONE-PAGE ABSTRACT to any one of the organizers by January 5,
2002.

mailings, send a note to this effect to Jim Bohman at the email address
