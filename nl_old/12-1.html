<br>
Outline and Research Questions:<br>
<br>
Computer simulations play a crucial role in many sciences, but they have not yet 
received the attention they deserve from philosophers of science. This 
conference attempts to systematically explore methodological issues in 
connection with computer simulations and the implications of these for 
traditional questions in the philosophy of science. Special emphasis is put on 
the relation between models and simulations as well as on the role of computers 
in the practice of science.<br>
<br>
The papers presented at the conference will address, among others, the following 
questions:<br>
<br>
1. What difference does the essentially dynamic nature of simulations make to 
modeling, particularly in their representational abilities?<br>
2. Is there a difference between simulations that have an explicit model or 
theory behind them and those that do not?<br>
3. When there is no model, what form does the representational connection 
between the simulation and the world take?<br>
4. Can any sense be made of claims that the world itself is carrying out 
computations and simulating itself?<br>
5. What role does intentionality play in simulations or such apparently 
automatic representational processes as genetic algorithms?<br>
6. Are there principles that one can use to decide whether a simulation is to be 
interpreted realistically or only instrumentally?<br>
7. At what level (e.g. the machine code, the algorithmic, the scientific 
language) does a simulation represent a system?<br>
8. It is well-known hat models enter into different relationships such as 
isomorphism, embedding, or being a submodel of. Are there analogous relations 
between simulations?<br>
9. What would qualify as an equivalence relation between simulations?<br>
10. What is the relation between simulations used as an experimental tool and 
real experiments?<br>
11. How does the methodology of simulations compare with experimentation?<br>
12. How, if at all, do models and simulations explain?<br>
13. What are the implications of the growing use of simulations in science for 
our understanding of science?<br>
14. What are the implications of the repeated use of the same models and 
simulations within different fields of science?<br>
15. How reliable are the results of simulations, and how is the reliability of a 
simulation determined?<br>
16. What role does mathematics play in simulations?<br>
17. Is there a difference between the use of simulations across different fields 
such as physics, biology, and the social sciences?<br>
18. Is there a difference between the use of simulations in fundamental science 
and in applied science?<br>
<br>
SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:<br>
<br>
Please send extended abstracts of 1000 words to simulations2006@yahoo.co.uk by 
15 March 2006. Decisions will be made by 1 April. A few travel bursaries for 
graduate students are available; if you wish to be considered please submit a 
short (tentative) travel budget and a CV together with your paper. There will 
also be a Best Graduate Paper Award of 500 EUROS. For details, visit the 
conference website.<br>
<br>
Although the conference has a philosophical orientation, contributions by 
historians and sociologists of science are welcome too. We particularly 
encourage working scientists to submit papers.<br>

6. CALL FOR PAPERS: Ashgate Companion to Contemporary Philosophy of Biology.<br>
<br>
Deadline: May 15, 2006.<br>
<br>
Editors:<br>
<br>
George Terzis, Department of Philosophy, Saint Louis University, 3800 Lindell 
Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63108. (314) 977-3163. terzisgn@slu.edu<br>

<br>
Call for Papers. We have been asked by Ashgate Publishing to edit their Ashgate 
Companion to Contemporary Philosophy of Biology. Our approach to this project 
will emphasize the importance of information-theoretic considerations as well as 
more familiar philosophical and scientific ones. Our rationale for this approach 
is that, although central to the biological sciences, the idea of information 
has received little attention from philosophers of biology. To address this 
omission, we seek papers on topics that employ this approach to advance 
understanding of topic-related philosophical problems and controversies. 
Although we have included a broad list of possible topics (see below), we are 
willing to consider others provided that they also reflect the collection¹s 
overall approach. Interested authors should include an abstract of the paper 
they propose for the collection (not to exceed 500 words), together with a copy 
of their cv. Abstracts should be submitted by May 15, 2006, and authors whose 
contributions are accepted will be informed by June 15, 2006. The deadline for 
accepted papers is February 1, 2007. Submit relevant materials to:<br>
terzisgn@slu.edu; arpr@southwestmsu.edu.<br>
<br>
Objectives of the Companion. Information pervades biological processes at all 
levels of organization. Familiar examples of these processes include how 
organisms utilize free energy, how DNA codes for protein synthesis, how genes 
regulate morphological development, and even how ensembles of nerve cells 
coordinate their activity in a way that enables some organisms to be<br>
aware of their environment. But although pervasive, the contribution that 
information-related ideas make to our understanding of these processes is not 
yet well understood. Indeed, only recently have researchers begun to explore 
their deeper theoretical significance. Of course, an understanding of these 
processes also depends on a variety of more traditional biological and 
non-biological scientific considerations. But the combining of these 
considerations with information-related ones will almost certainly add greater 
accuracy and depth to our grasp of such processes.<br>
<br>
A similar point may be made about our understanding of the traditional 
philosophical issues and controversies associated with the previously noted 
biological processes. For example, since organisms use information to construct, 
maintain, and replicate themselves, it would also seem natural to include 
information-related ideas in our attempt to understand the general nature of 
living systems, the causality by means of which they operate, their capacity to 
generate prolific bio-diversity, whether or not they could exist and evolve in 
non-biological matter, and how in some species they give rise to cognition and 
emotion. But, again, philosophers of biology have only begun to include 
information-related ideas in the repertoire of methodological considerations 
they use to discuss these philosophical issues.<br>
<br>
Our approach to this volume thus seeks to correct what we believe is a 
long-standing neglect of those informational considerations relevant to an 
understanding of both the scientific and philosophical significance of a variety 
of basic biological processes. To be sure, the inclusion of these considerations 
can only add to the controversies that already existed in their absence. For 
example, how closely or remotely related to one another are the informational 
ideas that are employed at different levels of biological organization? Second, 
although the presence of informational ideas at these levels is undeniable, 
their philosophical significance is another matter. Is that significance a 
literal one, or is it more metaphorical and heuristic? Finally, in order to 
defend a specific philosophical interpretation of these ideas, we require a more 
general information-theoretic perspective. But is there one such perspective, or 
are there different, competing ones? Although difficult questions, we feel that 
any aversion toward answering them is overridden by the fact, now nearly 
undeniable, that information is integral to our understanding of biological 
phenomena. For this reason, these questions are as much in need of further 
philosophical examination as are the more familiar ones.<br>
<br>
Audience. The collection of papers represents a broad range of disciplines, 
including anthropology, biology, chemistry, computer science, information 
theory, paleontology, philosophy, physics, psychology, and systems theory. The 
papers will be written to meet the needs of advanced undergraduate and graduate 
students enrolled in philosophy of science, philosophy of biology, and 
theoretical biology courses. The papers are also intended to enable interested 
researchers to learn about the contribution that information makes to both the 
biological sciences and philosophy of biology.<br>
<br>
Organization of the Text. Section 1, which introduces readers to the nature and 
methodology of philosophy of biology, incorporates not only traditional 
scientific and philosophical considerations, but also information-theoretic 
ones. Sections 2-7 then discuss a variety of increasingly complex biological 
topics to which this methodology can be applied. For example, Section 2 begins 
with the general idea of organisms as hierarchically organized systems that use 
information to construct, maintain, and replicate themselves, while Sections 3 
and 4 expand this idea to take into account the<br>
evolutionary character of organisms in both natural and artificial environments. 
Next, Sections 5 and 6 show that this idea can also be applied to psychological 
concepts in humans and higher primates. Finally, a conclusion summarizes the 
broader philosophical significance of the information-enhanced approach to the 
biological topics presented in this text.<br>

7. HPSM LISTSERV: Covering the History and Philosophy of Science in the 
Northeast of<br>
<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>England. <br>
<br>
The History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine (HPSM) Network was founded by 
Durham University's Department of Philosophy in 1999. The purpose of the HPSM 
listserv is to create a network for researchers with links to the north of 
England who are interested in topics broadly relevant to the history and 
philosophy of science and medicine (including bioarchaeology and palaeopathology). 
This is accomplished by posting messages that advertise HPSM events (lecture 
series, departmental seminars, individual papers, conferences, museum displays, 
etc.), research (new lectureships, research projects, funding proposals, etc.) 
and collections (material, archival, cyber, etc.). At present, the list has over 
one hundred academic subscribers, as well students reading for an MA or PhD in 
HPSM related subjects. The list includes staff members from the Centre for Life 
(Newcastle) and the universities of Durham, Newcastle, Sunderland, Teesside, 
York, Leeds, Manchester, Lancaster, Leicester and Warwick. However, there are 
several independent scholars too. The listserv is moderated, but it is open to 
anyone with a genuine interest in HPSM studies. To join, simply send an email to 
Dr Matthew D Eddy (M.D.Eddy@durham.ac.uk).<br>

<br>
The Departments of Chemistry at University of Zagreb, and University of Split 
invite you kindly to participate the ISPC 10 Symposium that will be organized in 
Split, Croatia, from 6 till 10 August 2006.<br>
<br>
Tentative schedule:<br>
<br>
Sunday afternoon: Registration and opening reception.<br>
Monday: Opening plenary session, contributed papers.<br>
Tuesday: Plenary session, contributed papers.<br>
Wednesday: Plenary session, contributed papers, conference Banquet.<br>
Thursday: Closing session, executive committee meeting. Departure.<br>
<br>
Sightseeing and social events include tours of the museums and galleries 
(Archeology museum, Museum of old Croatian monuments, etc.) in Split, visits to 
the old Roman center as well as boat excursion on the Adriatic.<br>
<br>
Facilities: Symposium sessions will be held in the Student Center - Spinut - of 
the University of Split. On the same place are also dormitories. Photographs of 
this place are attached to this Invitation. Lecturing hall contains auditorium 
with seating capacity ranging from 100 to 150. All the conventional audiovisual 
equipment including computer projection is available. There is also coffee bar 
and restaurant for refreshments.<br>
<br>
Housing will be arranged in the University dormitories at Spinut campus (street 
Sinjska 6) and at local hotels, which are within walking distance of campus. 
Campus prices for single room is 150 Kn per person, double room 1s 130 Kn per 
person (Note that 1 USD = 6 Kn, or 1EURO = 7.35 Kn). Inexpensive meals are 
available in on-campus dining facilities. There is also a broad range of 
restaurants within walking distance because Campus is very close to the center 
of Split.<br>
<br>
Location and Transportation: After Zagreb, Split is the largest city in Croatia. 
It is located in the most attractive region of Croatia, in central Dalmatia on 
the Adriatic coast. Transportation to Split is simple because there is 
international airport. There are also many fast inter-city train connections 
with Zagreb, and people coming by car can use the highway A-1, E-71 (nearly 400 
km from Zagreb). Croatia Airlines flights daily on the line Zagreb - Split. 
Another possibility is to use Dubrovnik international airport, which is 200 
kilometers away from Split.<br>
<br>
Registration fee: Following the tradition of the ISPC symposia, on the 
Conference is only the voluntary registration fee of $20. <br>
<br>
Publication of Symposium Papers: Several recent symposia have resulted in 
published volumes. Every effort will be made to provide an appropriate venue for 
publication of the papers presented at this symposium. A special issue of

A. The purpose of this newsletter<br>
<br>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis by the 
Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information. The newsletter is 
moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to members of the 
Association (e.g., official business of the Association, information about 
upcoming meetings or other information likely to be of interest to a broad range 
of membership). <br>
<br>
B. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONS<br>
<br>
Send information for possible inclusion in a future issue of the newsletter to 
the editor (mforster@wisc.edu). It is best to send the information directly to 
the editor well in advance of any deadline because publication dates are 
unpredictable. Please include PSA somewhere in the subject line (so that the 
message is automatically filed).<br>
<br>
C. DIRECTIONS FOR SUBSCRIBING OR UNSUBSCRIBING<br>
