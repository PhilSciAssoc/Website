The slate this year was very competitive and the results were quite close. I 
congratulate the new officers, and thank all of&nbsp; the candidates for their 
participation: the PSA&nbsp; completely depends upon its elected officers to keep it

&nbsp;4. &nbsp;&nbsp;JOB:&nbsp; Postdoctoral Fellow, Amherst College, Law and Science. Deadline: 
March 25, 2005.<br>
<br>
</span></font>Amherst College seeks a postdoctoral fellow for a two-year 
appointment as a visiting assistant professor in the field of law and science. 
The fellow will teach one course per semester, and the rest of the time will be 
divided between curricular development and his/her own research. We welcome 
inquiries from candidates who have done graduate work in the social, historical, 
or philosophical studies of science and technology, as well as from scientists 
or legal scholars with special expertise in the role of science in law or the 
role of law in science. We are interested, among other things, in how knowledge 
practices in law are shaped by science and in the ways knowledge practices in 
the sciences are shaped by law. In addition, we are interested in how scientific 
institutions incorporate, respond to, and resist the external constraints 
imposed by law. Examples of courses that might be taught include: <i>
<span style="font-style: italic">DNA: Scientific Revolution and Its Legal 
Impact; The Science of Forensics; Evidentiary Processes in Law and Science; 
Intellectual Property, Biotechnology, and Society; and Privacy and Property in 
the Internet Age.<br>
<br>
</span></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12pt">
Candidates should submit a letter of application explaining the relation of 
their research and teaching interests to this position, a curriculum vitae, 
sample syllabi for undergraduate courses, and a sample of written work (an 
article or chapter, e.g.). Candidates should also arrange for three letters of 
recommendation to be sent directly to the Search Committee. All application 
materials should be sent to Professor John W. Servos, Search Committee in Law 
and Science, Department of History, Amherst College, Amherst MA 01002. Closing 
date for applications is March 25, 2005.<br>

</span><span style="font-size: 12pt">6.&nbsp;&nbsp; CALL FOR PAPERS: &nbsp;Interactivist Summer 
Institute 2005, September 19-23, 2005.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madren Conference Center Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, 
USA.<br>
<br>
Join us in exploring the frontiers of understanding of life, mind, and 
cognition. There is a growing recognition - across many disciplines - that 
phenomena of life and mind, including cognition and representation, are 
emergents of far-from-equilibrium, interactive, autonomous systems. Mind and 
biology, mind and agent, are being re-united. The classical treatment of 
cognition and representation within a formalist framework of encodingist 
assumptions is widely recognized as a fruitless maze of blind alleys. From 
neurobiology to robotics, from cognitive science to philosophy of mind and 
language, dynamic and interactive alternatives are being explored. Dynamic 
systems approaches and autonomous agent research join in the effort.<br>
<br>
The interactivist model offers a theoretical approach to matters of life and 
mind, ranging from evolutionary- and neuro-biology - including the emergence of 
biological function - through representation, perception, motivation, memory, 
learning and development, emotions, consciousness, language, rationality, 
sociality, personality and psychopathology. This work has developed interfaces 
with studies of central nervous system functioning, the ontology of process, 
autonomous agents, philosophy of science, and all areas of psychology, 
philosophy, and cognitive science that address the person.<br>
<br>
The conference will involve both tutorials addressing central parts and aspects 
of the interactive model, and papers addressing current work of relevance to 
this general approach. This will be our third Summer Institute; the first was in 
2001 at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA, and the second was in 2003 in 
Copenhagen, Denmark. The intention is for this Summer Institute to become a 
traditional biennial meeting where those sharing the core ideas of interactivism 
will meet and discuss their work, try to reconstruct its historical roots, put 
forward current research in different fields that fits the interactivist 
framework, and define research topics for prospective graduate students. People 
working in philosophy of mind, linguistics, social sciences, artificial 
intelligence, cognitive robotics, theoretical biology, and other fields related 
to the sciences of mind are invited to send their paper submission or statement 
of interest for participation to the organizers.<br>
