        <br />
        <br />This conference centers around the theme of
        'scientific understanding'. The notion of scientific
        understanding is closely related to that of scientific
        explanation, but while explanation is widely discussed in
        philosophy of science, not much work has focused explicitly
        on understanding. One reason is that traditional
        philosophers of science have long regarded it as 'merely' a
        psychological notion, and thereby as philosophically
        irrelevant. This attitude, however, is slowly disappearing,
        and interest in the topic of understanding is growing. With
        this conference we hope to stimulate the 
        <br />development of philosophical research into scientific
        understanding.
        <br />
        <br />The conference is intended for philosophers of
        science working on the topic of scientific understanding
        itself, or on related topics such as explanation, modeling,
        representation, etc.; and for historians and sociologists
        of science, cognitive scientists, and others having an
        interest in philosophical questions regarding scientific
        understanding.

        <br />CALL FOR PAPERS:
        <br />We welcome contributed papers, which will be
        programmed in parallel sessions (45-60 minute presentation
        including discussion). We aim at a varied programme, in
        which philosophical questions about the nature of
        scientific understanding will be approached in different
        ways. In addition to contributions of a general
        philosophical nature, we hope to be able to present studies
        focused on a wide range of sciences, both natural and
        social. Although the conference has a philosophical
        orientation, contributions by historians and sociologists
        of science, cognitive scientists, and others, are welcome,
        as long as they are relevant to the general philosophical
        theme. 
        <br />
        <br />Possible topics are: 
        <br />- The relation between explanation and understanding
        in science 
        <br />- Understanding and types of scientific explanation
        (causal, mechanistic, functional, 
        unifying, etc.). 
        <br />
        - Is understandingepistemic,
        pragmatic, or both? 
        <br />- Models, analogies, and intelligibility 
        <br />- Cognitive science and scientific understanding 
        <br />- 
        Is understandingindividual or
        social? 
        <br />- Understanding in the various sciences: similarities
        and differences 
        <br />- Case studies from the practice and history of
        science 
        <br />
        <br />Please send an abstract of 450 words, and full
        contact information, to:

      <br />Probability is not only a
        keyconcept in  many branches of
      physics,  but has also  been   attracting  the   attention 
      from  philosophers.    For
        example, probabilities   play  
      a  crucial   role   in   quantum   mechanics  and   its
      interpretations.  Also, the concept of probability has
      continually been at the center of philosophical debate in the
      foundations of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.  
      Recent
        developments  in  quantum 
      information  theory  have reinvigorated philosophical 
      interest in probabilities.   
      <br />
      <br />This summer school is geared to doctoral students and
      postdoctoral researchers in
        philosophy   of  physics, 
      philosophy   of  science,  and   philosophy  of probability,
      as  well as philosophically  minded physicists.  We aim
        tobring this group together with
      leading  experts on probability in physical theories. Our 
      method will  be to  use probabilities  as a  leitmotif 
      through different subjects  in  the  philosophy  of  physics 
      and  to  analyze  the  concept  of probability   from  
      different    theoretical   viewpoints:   probability in
      thermodynamics, statistical physics, quantum mechanics and
      quantum information theory, as well as space time theories. 
      Experts will give lectures on each of these topics. Our
        mainlecturers are C.

        of mind and language and/or logic.
        <br />
        <br />Candidates should have demonstrated strengths in
        teaching and research, and have completed, or be about to
        complete, a PhD degree.  The successful applicant will be
