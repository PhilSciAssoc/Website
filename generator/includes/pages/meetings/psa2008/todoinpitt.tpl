Things to do in Downtown Pittsburgh

<h1>Things to do in Downtown Pittsburgh</h1>
<p>
Pittsburgh has a compact
and vibrant downtown. Almost everything listed below is within a short
walk of the conference site. If you have time for only one little
excursion, we recommend taking a stroll to the rivers and across the
bridges. The bridges to the Northside at 6th, 7th and 9th Streets are
especially charming. The bridge at 6th Street takes you directly to the
new baseball park, <a href="http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/pit/ballpark/index.jsp" rel="external">PNC
Park</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you want to take a longer walk, head west to Point State Park, which
is the park located at the spot where the Allegheny and Monongahela
Rivers join to form the Ohio River. From there you have a spectacular
view of football field, <a href="http://www.steelers.com/heinzfield/" rel="external">Heinz Field</a>.

<h2>Performing Arts</h2>
<p>
Downtown Pittsburgh has many good theaters and concert halls
within a
short walk of the conference site. </p>
