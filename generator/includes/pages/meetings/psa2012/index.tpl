<a id="chairing"> </a><h2>Chairing at PSA2012</h2>
<p>
Session chairs for PSA2012 will be selected from a pool of volunteers. 
Those interested in chairing a session at PSA2012 must complete the 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&amp;formkey=dDR1Rm0wWm54LXQ1V2lGSHZFNlJtdkE6MQ" rel="external">PSA2012 Chair Volunteer Form</a>. 
Prospective volunteers are urged to read 
the following from Andrea Woody, PSA2012 Program Chair:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The number of requests we can accommodate will depend on the number of 
requests we receive; we will have approximately 30 sessions in need of 
chairs. Priority will be given to those who have the relevant expertise 
for the topic of the session, those who submitted a contributed paper or 
symposium material for PSA2012 that was not accepted for the program, 
and those who are PSA members. As no one may appear more than once in a 
substantive role on the PSA2012 program, those already on the PSA2012 
program should not volunteer to chair (those on the HSS program are not, 
however, barred from also appearing on the PSA2012 program).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Volunteers for chairing at PSA2012 should complete the online form. If 
you encounter difficulty completing the online form, please contact 
Gary Hardcastle (<a href="mailto:ghardcas@bloomu.edu" rel="email">ghardcas@bloomu.edu</a>) 
or Andrea Woody (<a href="mailto:awoody@u.washington.edu" rel="email">awoody@u.washington.edu</a>).
<strong>Volunteers will be accepted until August 25.</strong>

or Greg Macklem (<a href="mailto:greg@hssonline.org" rel="email">greg@hssonline.org</a>)

<a id="travel"> </a><h2>Travel Details</h2>

<h3>Traveling to San Diego</h3>
<p>
<strong>By Plane:</strong> San Diego is served by San Diego 
International Airport (SAN), less than a mile from the San Diego 
Sheraton. The San Diego Sheraton runs complimentary 24-hour airport 
shuttles (between 12-5 AM, call the hotel from the airport to request a 
shuttle).
</p>
<p>
<strong>By Train:</strong> The San Diego train station (known as the 
<a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=am/am2Station/Station_Page&amp;code=SAN" rel="external">Santa Fe Depot</a>) 
is serviced by Amtrak. The station is approximately 3 miles from the 
meeting hotel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>By Car:</strong> San Diego can be reached by car via Interstates 
5, 8, or 15. Parking at the Sheraton San Diego ranges from $22-$30/day.
</p>
<p>
For more information regarding travel to San Diego, see the 
<a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/property/area/transportation.html?propertyID=127" rel="external">Sheraton San Diego website</a>.
</p>

<h3>Traveling Within San Diego</h3>
<p>
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings during the PSA/HSS meetings 
(15-17 November), two 49-passenger motor coaches will offer 
conference-goers complimentary shuttle service from the Sheraton San 
Diego to various locations in downtown San Diego.
</p>

<h3>NSF Travel Grants</h3>
<p>
As in past years, a grant from the National Science Foundation will be 
used to provide money for travel and registration costs to graduate 
students, independent scholars (including retired scholars) and recent 
PhDs participating in the 2012 PSA or HSS meetings. <strong>Unlike past 
years, though, only U.S. citizens and individuals currently associated 
with U.S. institutions are eligible for an NSF Travel Grant.</strong> In 
order to be eligible for an NSF Travel Grant, applicants must 
participate in the 2012 conferences by, for example, presenting a paper, 
chairing a session, commentating on a paper, or participating in the 
governance of a society.
</p>
<p>
NSF Travel Grants are available in amounts up to $750 for domestic 
travel and $1000 for international travel. They can be used for 
transportation to and from the conference hotel and conference 
registration, but not for lodging or food. Money awarded through an NSF 
Travel Grant is paid after the conference in the form of reimbursement 
for expenses. Reimbursement forms will be emailed to recipients and will 
be available on the HSS and PSA meeting websites after the conferences.
</p>
<p><strong>
If you are participating in PSA2012; a graduate student, independent 
scholar (including retired scholar), or recent PhD; and a U.S. citizen 
or currently associated with a U.S. institution, you are strongly 
encouraged to <a href="https://hssweb.org/travelgrants/" rel="external">apply online</a> 
for an NSF Travel Grant.
</strong></p>
<p>
Please be aware that requests for travel funds regularly exceed the 
money available. Submitting an application for an NSF Travel Grant does 
not guarantee that we will be able to reimburse your travel costs.

<a id="childcare"> </a><h2>Childcare</h2>
<p>
In recognition of the particular challenges faced by those attending the 
meetings with children, we are working to reserve a family room in the 
conference space for the use of attendees with children. Additionally, 
our Local Arrangements Committee is preparing a Guide to San Diego that 
will highlight local attractions, events, and resources of interest to 
those attending the meetings with children. Watch the PSA2012 site for 
further information.
</p>
<p>
The PSA provides the following links to childcare services in the San 
Diego area. These links are provided only for informational purposes; no 
endorsement is intended.
