	<li><span class="bold">HOTEL RESERVATIONS:</span> The conference hotel, the historic William Penn Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, is already full, but Jay Malone of HSS has secured overflow space at the Doubletree Hotel (at the conference rate) directly behind the William Penn and the Westin, which is down the street from the conference hotel.

			You can board the bus from the same part of the airport as the limousine and taxis.
			Disembark at the intersection of 7th Ave and William Penn Place downtown.
			The William Penn Hotel is two short blocks south on William Penn Place.
			Cost is $2.60 one way.

	<li><span class="bold">THINGS TO DO IN DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH</span> information is <a href="http://philsci.org/conferences/psa2008/to-do-in-pitt.html">here</a>.</li>
	<li><span class="bold">CHILDCARE IN PITTSBURGH</span> at the PSA/HSS Meetings.<br />
		Parents and guardians may arrange for childcare through <a href="http://www.rentamominpittsburgh.com/" rel="external">Rent-A-Mom, Inc.</a>
		The agency prefers that you contact them directly.
		Please phone 412-722-9445 and ask for Suzanne or <a href="mailto:pghrentamom@aol.com" rel="email">email her</a>.
		Rent-A-Mom prefers that you contact them at least two weeks prior to the meeting.
		We hope to subsidize costs but this is not assured.
		You should tell the agency that you are attending the History of Science Society/Philosophy of Science Association meeting to be held at the Omni William Penn.
		Also let them know if you are interested in sharing a nanny with someone else attending the conference.
		They try to match the nannies with the children's age and temperament so sharing may be difficult.
		<ul class="bullets">
			<li>When making arrangements, the agency will need to know to whom the room is registered, the names of the children, ages, hours of coverage needed, a credit card (Visa, MasterCard or Discover). You will be advised of the cash-payment process to the nanny and also the service rate which is on a credit card and asked to provide an email address for a receipt.</li>
			<li>The agency will let you know who the nanny is, along with information regarding her work background, age, time with Rent A Mom, etc. The family will be contacted by its nanny before they come to town. The nanny will report to the front desk of the hotel, and come up to the hotel room where the child is.</li>
			<li>Rates: For the nanny: $12/hour plus an hourly parking reimbursement. For Rent-A-Mom: $5/hour. So $17/hour total, plus an hourly parking reimbursement. There's a 4-hour minimum. There is a public garage across the street from the hotel which charges $5 (flat rate) after 4 p.m. and on weekends.</li>
			<li>Group: If a group wants to go in together on childcare, only one representative of the group need contact Rent-a-Mom. Nannies report to the front desk and proceed to the hotel room or rooms where the children are. The rule of thumb is 1 nanny per 4 children (although e.g. infants require a higher nanny: child ratio). The children cared for by the nanny can change during her tour of duty, provided that he or she is never responsible for more than 4 children [or the corrected maximum #, given the ages etc of the children].</li>
			<li>Group Rates: For the nanny: $14/hour plus an hourly parking reimbursement. For Rent-A-Mom: $5/hours. So $19/hour total, plus an hourly parking reimbursement. There's a 4-hour minimum.</li>

	<li><span class="bold">FIELD TRIPS</span> at the PSA/HSS Meetings, November 6–8, 2008, in Pittsburgh, PA. Registration for field trips will be available with conference registration, which will in turn be available in early August. Each trip can accommodate 38 persons.
		<ul class="bullets">
			<li><span class="bold">Field Trip to Muddy Creek</span> ($15) Friday, 1–5 p.m. Discover the early oil and gas industry around Pittsburgh and visit the fields between Pittsburgh and Muddy Creek (guided by geologist Kathy Flaherty).
