Audio/Visual Equipment and Registration Fees

<h1>A Note on Registration Fees and Audio/Visual Equipment</h1>
<p>
This is the second time that the History of Science Society will be 
providing LCD projectors (beamers) in all of its meeting rooms, and the 
first time that all of the PSA rooms will have projectors. Because these 
projectors are expensive, and thus impact the registration fees, 
registrants for both the HSS and PSA meetings should be aware of the 
history that went into that decision. 
</p>
<p>
In 1998, the HSS Council voted to equip one hi-tech room for each 
meeting, a room that held three types of projectors: LCD (beamer), 
slide, and overhead. The decision was made in the face of increasing 
demand for LCD projectors, which, at the time, cost $800 - $1,200US per 
day to rent. To have filled all requests for these projectors, fueled by 
the rise of Powerpoint, would have easily doubled registration fees. 
Much has changed in the interim but not everything: Kodak no longer 
makes slide projectors, overhead projectors are seldom used, and almost 
all requests for projection equipment are now for LCDs. And although the 
price for such projectors has dropped considerably, the price is still 
substantial: bids for LCD projectors for the Montréal ranged from 
$375-$1,000/day. And when you consider the various charges that come 
with a/v – microphones, screens, carts, portable speakers, patch fees – 
the costs are significant. 
</p>
<p> 
Now that you can buy an LCD for a few hundred dollars, many people have 
suggested that we simply purchase our own and bring them to the meetings. 
This would be a mistake for a number of reasons: such equipment is 
fragile and expensive to ship; we would still have to hire individuals 
to set up the equipment, tear it down and troubleshoot (labor costs are 
a large part of any a/v bid); equipment quickly becomes obsolete; and 
projectors that provide sufficient illumination in a large room cost 
much more than the projectors you carry in your bag. In the end, it is 
the labor part of the equation that is the most significant. When a 
projector malfunctions, it is essential that a trained technician is on 
hand to solve the problem – those who are presenting their papers will 
not be given a second chance.
</p>
<p> 
And it was not just price that prompted the resistance to using LCD 
projectors. We have heard many complaints over the years where projector 
were used as a crutch to support a weak presentation and in too many 
cases individuals would simply read what was on the screen, a sure way 
to lose one's audience. Words still count and one of the best examples 
of this is the internet spoof where Abraham Lincoln gives his Gettysburg 
Address using Powerpoint. 
</p>
<p>
But Powerpoint is a prominent feature in education today and the good 
will lost in trying to determine who REALLY needed a projector for their 
presentations, trying to assign rooms based on projector availability, 
trying to switch projectors from room to room, trying to explain to a 
panicked individual that he did not request a projector so there is not 
one available, and trying to convince local organizers to borrow 
projectors from their local universities, ended up eroding the quality 
of the meeting and the quality of the experience. So, for the 2010 
conference, we are equipping each room with a projector. To do so means 
an increase in registration fees but we hope that the extra cost is 
justified by a more effective delivery of information. What we are not 
providing are computers, which would also ratchet up the registration 
fees. Given the ubiquity of laptops, we feel that some simple 
coordination among presenters will allow seamless use of a common 
computer and we appreciate all of those who bring their own equipment, 
which helps us combat rising registration fees.
