<a id="top"> </a><h1>Call for Symposium Proposals and Workshop Proposals</h1>

<h2>Philosophy of Science Association</h2>

<h3>Twentieth Biennial Meeting: November 2-5, 2006<br/>
Vancouver, British Columbia</h3>

<p>
Members of the Philosophy of Science Association (PSA) are invited to
submit proposals for symposia and workshops to be presented at the PSA
2006 meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, November 2-5.  Proposals
must include sufficient supporting material to permit the program
committee to evaluate the quality and interest of the symposium or
workshop.  See below for details.
</p>
<p>
Symposia will follow the traditional format, whereby the papers
presented will be submitted for consideration for publication in a
supplementary issue of Philosophy of Science.  The evaluation for
publication will be on entire sessions; that is, all papers in the
session will be published together.  All contributions for symposia will
be electronically archived, whether or not they are accepted for
publication.
</p>
<p>
Workshops follow the same format as used for PSA 2004.  There is no
expectation that the papers presented will be submitted for review for
publication.  This format may be more attractive for sessions involving
participants from outside the philosophical community, or for
exploratory research.  Authors may choose to have their papers
archived in electronic form.  Some workshops may take the form of lunch
roundtables or mentoring sessions.
</p>
<p>
Proposals for both symposia and workshops should include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The title of the proposed symposium or workshop</li>
<li>A description of the topic and a justification of its current
	importance to the discipline (about one or two pages)</li>
<li>A short descriptive summary of the proposal (100-200 words)</li>
<li>Titles and abstracts of all papers</li>
<li>A list of participants and either an abbreviated curriculum vitae or
	short biographical description for each</li>
<li>Institutional affiliation and e-mail addresses for all participants</li>
<li>Full contact information for the organizer (who may or may not be a
	proposed speaker), to be used for communication with the Program Committee</li>
</ol>
<p>
The PSA 2006 Program Committee will strive for quality, variety,
innovation and diversity on the program.  We encourage proposals in both
traditional and novel areas of philosophy of science.  Members of the committee
are listed at: http://philsci.org/conferences/psa2006/program_committee.html [broken]
</p>
<p>
The deadline for Symposium and Workshop proposals is December 1, 2005.
Decisions about acceptance will be made by mid-February, 2005.
