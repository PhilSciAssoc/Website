<h2>Philosophy of Science Association</h2>

<h3>Twentieth Biennial Meeting: November 2-5, 2006<br/>
Vancouver, British Columbia</h3>

<p>
Members of the Philosophy of Science Association (PSA) are invited to submit
papers to be presented at the PSA 2006 meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia on
November 2-5.  Contributed papers may be on any topic in the philosophy of
science.  The PSA 2006 Program Committee will strive for quality, variety,
innovation and diversity on the program.  We encourage papers in both
traditional and novel areas of philosophy of science.
</p>
<p>
The deadline for paper submissions is March 15, 2006.  Some papers will be
accepted for both presentation at the PSA 2006 meeting and publication in a
supplementary issue of Philosophy of Science; other papers will be accepted just
for presentation.  Both types of accepted paper will be electronically published
prior to the meeting.  In each case, the Program Committee expects to make its
decision by mid-June, 2006.  Final versions of all papers accepted for
publication must be submitted by January 15, 2007.
</p>
<p>
The maximum manuscript length is 5,000 words, including footnotes and
references.  If the text includes tables or figures, an appropriate number of
words should be subtracted from the limit.  Submissions must include a 100-word
abstract and a word count.  Format and citation style should match those of the
journal Philosophy of Science (see
<a href="http://journal.philsci.org/format.html" rel="external">http://journal.philsci.org/Guidelines/</a>
for details).  Submissions should be prepared for blind review, with no
identifying information in the body of the paper or abstract.  (See
http://philsci.org/conferences/psa2006/blinding.html [broken] for guidelines
about blinding papers.)</p>
<p>
Authors of accepted papers are expected to present abbreviated versions of their
papers, with a time limit of twenty minutes.
