<p class="bold">
If you have any questions about how, when,
or by whom, the decision to publish your paper will be made, please contact the program chairs, not the journal
office.  The journal office handles the mechanics of publishing the Proceedings, but is not involved in any decisions
about which papers will be published.

<span class="bold">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PUBLICATION</span>:  Delivering your
paper at the PSA meeting does <span class="italic">not</span> mean that it will be
published in the proceedings issue of <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>.
You <span class="italic">must</span> receive confirmation
from the Program Chairs before your paper will be published.  If you have any questions, please contact the
Program Chairs for further information.  <span class="italic">They will contact you if your paper is going to be published.</span>

</p>

<p>
Please take careful note of the types of computer file that the journal can handle, and of the guidelines regarding
references.  Be especially careful about ensuring that your references are complete.  The Editorial Office cannot
complete references -- incomplete references will be returned to the author for completion.  The length of your
paper is strictly limited to 5000 words, inclusive of abstract, footnotes, and any other material.
Reasonable compensation (i.e., lowering of the limit) should be made for any figures, tables, or equations
(set off from the text) in your paper.
</p>

<p>
Figures should be sent as separate files, in any standard graphic format (for example, .gif, .jpg, .eps, .tif). They
should be high-quality, print-ready.  NB:  Figures drawn in Microsoft Word's drawing feature are not usable
by the journal.  Please use a standard graphic format.  If you have a question email the editorial office,
whose contact information is at:  <a href="http://journal.philsci.org/contact.html">http://journal.philsci.org/Contact/</a>
