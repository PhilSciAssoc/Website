	The PSA holds a major conference every two years (in even years), typically in early November.
	Calls for papers and other proposed sessions typically go out about a year before the conference.
	These calls are advertised here and reproduced in the PSA Newsletter.
	The proceedings are published in two volumes of <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>.

	The next meeting is the <a href="[PREFIX]meetings/psa2010/index.html">PSA 2010 Biennial Meeting</a>, information for which can be found at that web page.
