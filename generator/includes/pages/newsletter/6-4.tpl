 1. NSF FUNDING SUPPORT FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
</p>
<p>
Letter from Bruce E. Seely, Program Director for Science and Technology
Studies:
</p>
<p>
The National Science Foundation's program in Science and Technology Studies
is the primary supporter of research in the field of philsophy and related
areas of STS. The STS Program's annual budget for 1999-2000 was $3.5 million
and will increase this year, for the NSF is slated to received the largest
annual budget increase in its history. A variety of mechanisms buttress the
varied educational and scholarly efforts of the members of PSA. I write to
draw the attention of PSA members to the various opportunities at the
program, which include both traditional modes of support that many know
about, and new and emerging possibilities.   I also want to address basic
procedural changes taking place at NSF that effect the entire STS community.
</p>
<p>
For several decades, the National Science Foundation has supported the
scholarly efforts of philosophers of science and related fields of STS. The
most common award from the Science and Technology Studies Program is the STS
Scholars Awards, which supports research by an individual scholar for an
academic year, summer(s), or for longer periods of time.   Support can
include salary, travel and research expenses, assistance for graduate and
undergraduates, and other costs.  Grants for Collaborative Research support
projects involving several investigators. Two different types of STS
Fellowships are available.  Postdoctoral Fellowships are for scholars within
five years of the award date of their doctoral degrees. Professional
Development Fellowships offer opportunities for more senior scholars who
seek to gain formal knowledge of science and technology specialties (for
philosophers and social scientists) or in the humanities and social sciences
(for scientists and engineers) in order to improve their STS activities.
Doctoral Dissertation Research Grants support research expenses not normally
available through the student's university.  Small Grants for Training and
Research provide sustained research opportunities for a group of graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows on important issues or topics in STS.
These opportunities usually extend for three years.  The program also
accepts proposals for Conferences and Workshops, with support normally
limited to $10,000.  Small Grants for Exploratory Research also are
available; please contact the program to discuss the guidelines governing
such proposals. The program also supports efforts designed to expand the
research experiences of undergraduates (REU).  Detailed information on all
of these activities, program guidelines, and application materials can be
found at the Program's website (http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/sts/start.htm).
The next target date for the submission of proposals is 1 February 2001.
The Program is eager to see more proposals from philosophers working on
topics within the STS umbrella.  Please contact the Program with questions
about eligibility or the application process.  (Contact information below.)
</p>
<p>
The NSF also has a range of additional opportunities for STS scholars in
other Foundation programs.  Many of these may involve topics and questions
far from the interests of most philosophers, but the Program would be
interested in connecting philosophers of science to opportunities when
appopriate.  Perhaps the most important linkage to other  programs is the
Societal Dimensions of Engineering, Science, and Technology Program (SDEST).
It supports studies considering the ethical and values elements in science
and technology, as well as research related to "improving approaches and
information for decision making concerning management and direction of
research, science, and technology."  SDEST Program Director Rachelle D.
Hollander often collaborates with the STS Program in co-funding projects
related to ethics.  For more information, see the SDEST webpage:
http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/sdest/start.htm
</p>
<p>
Other opportunities that many STS scholars do not often know about are found
in the NSF's International Program Offices (INT).  The International Program
encourages collaboration between American scholars and in the rest of the
world in all fields of science.  Funding is often available for travel aimed
at developing such connections at all levels, from graduate students to
senior scholars.  INT is especially interested in supporting postdoctoral
exchanges, and support exists for organizing conferences to open exchange.
Research collaborations also are supported.  INT is especially eager to
expand connections to the lesser developed nations, particularly in Africa.
STS scholars can obtain INT funding to supplement a regular award, or can
apply directly to INT.  For more information, see the INT web page,
especially the anouncement International Opportunities for Scientists and
Engineers, NSF 00-138:   http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/int/start.htm
</p>
<p>
In recent years,the NSF has focused funds on special research initiatives of
timely importance.  These reach across the entire Foundation.  Several have
been targeted at encouraging broader participation in science by
under-represented groups.  These include Professional Opportunities for
Women in Research and Education (POWRE);  Faculty Early Career Development
Awards (CAREER);  Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowships;  and Career
Advancement Awards for Minority Scientists and Engineers.  Other initiatives
are focused on specific research topics of potentially great importance.
These tend to have a three-year life, and provide special resources.  STS
scholars are encouraged to propsoe projects for funding.  Information about
all cross-cutting programs of  NSF can be accessed at:
http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/
</p>
<p>
The most current research initiatives are Nanoscale Science and Engineering
and Information Technology Research (ITR).   The target date has just passed
for Nanotechnology area, but scholars interested in the social, political,
historical, and  societal impacts aspects of nanotechnology should watch for
the next announcement.  The initiative specifically seeks to fund work in
these areas.  See the website at
http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/nano/start.htm
</p>
<p>
It is not too late, however, to seek funding from the largest current
initiative, ITR.  Indeed, this initiative is perfectly suited for many STS
scholars, as the program announcement for 2000-2001 includes special
attention to People and Social Groups Interacting with Computers and
Infrastructure. Designated topics include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Social, Economic, Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Technology</li>
<li>Information Technology and Social Transformations</li>
<li>Information Technology for Distributed and Collective Action</li>
<li>Information Technology in the Social and Behavioral Sciences</li>
<li>Information Technology in Education</li>
<li>IT Workforce</li>
</ul>
<p>
The deadline for receipt of proposals seeking less than $500,000 from ITR is
January 22-24, 2001.  With a total initiative budget of $215 million for
2000-2001, I'd like to see a strong group of STS proposals in the
competition.  The details can be found at  http://www.itr.nsf.gov/.
Moreover, individuals willing to serve on panels evaluate the proposals
should consult the web page and complete an application (see the top of that
page).
</p>
<p>
CHANGES AT NSF: THE ELECTRONIC WORLD OF FASTLANE
</p>
<p>
Let me conclude with comments about basic process changes at NSF that affect
PSA members.  The Foundation has been developing a paperless submission and
review process for several years.  The key feature is a web-based interface
called FASTLANE.  Eventually, this mechanism will allow all steps in the
submission and management of grants to be handled electronically.
</p>
<p>
Many PSA members will encounter the changes most directly when submitting a
proposal.  The days of mailing 19 copies of a proposal to Washington are
over.  As of 1 October 2000, the Foundation requires that ALL proposals,
reviews, and reports be submitted digitally through FASTLANE.  Independent
scholars may apply for a waiver, but everyone else must use the new system.
This requires, however, that proposals be translated into PDF files in order
to maintain formatting.  Fortunately, NSF soon will translate Word,
WordPerfect, or other formats into PDF. All these steps are spelled out on
the FASTLANE web site:  http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov. Usually the process
works smoothly.  And FASTLANE does allow much more rapid transmission of
copies at much lower cost and with substantial savings in paper.  Moreover,
once you have received an award, it will be a little easier to handle
administrative details, such as requesting extensions and submitting annual
reports.  But please be aware that it may take a little more time at first.
You should draw upon the expertise of your sponsored research offices.
</p>
<p>
The FASTLANE process also is changing all the time.  For example, many
individuals whose proposals were not chosen for funding this fall will be
notified of the decision by email, not by mail.   Eventually all
communications will come by email.  At the moment, I am most concerned about
FASTLANE review of proposals.  Many of you know that the STS program
requests 4-6 scholars to evaluate every proposal.  In the past, the proposal
was mailed to reviewers, with instructions and criteria for conducting the
review.  Reviews were then mailed or emailed back to the NSF.  From now on,
however, reviewers will receive a request to review via email.  The message
contains instructions for accessing the proposals on the web, for printing a
copy, and for submitting the review through FASTLANE.  The Program and the
review panel benefit enormously from this approach, for individual reviews
can be seen much more quickly.  But a number of reviewers this fall found
that FASTLANE still has unfortunate teething problems.  One person labeled
it SLOWLANE, after encountering problems getting into FASTLANE. Often
problems were caused by the arrivalof a large number of proposals to NSF.
In early August, for example, 5000 CAREER proposals arriving the same day
crashed the entire system.
</p>
<p>
I've gone into detail here to ask for your continued cooperation and
patience as this change of process continues.  While it is interesting (as a
historian of technology) to watch this large organization cope with change
in its large technical systems, reviewers encountering problems are more
likely to be frustrated and angry than professionally interested. Those of
you asked to review proposals (more than 300 people this fall alone) need to
know the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you experienced difficulties in reviewing proposals, I extend sincere
apologies.  The process is supposed to be easier, but sometimes it failed.
I'm very grateful for the extended efforts of some of you to transmit your
reviews.</li>

<li>Please realize that NSF and the STS Program depend heavily upon the
efforts of its volunteer reviewers.  The importance of the reviews has not
been diminished by the shift in communication media.  The program cannot
make good choices without the guidance of experts in the various fields of
research.  So please try and help if you are asked to provide an evaluation.
About half the scholars who are asked do so, but the committee of visitors
that reviewed the STS program last May expressed concern about this rate of
return. The process may seem a little impersonal,  but please realize that
your efforts are truly appreciated.</li>

<li>Let me ask for your patience as the change-over to a "paperless"
electronic world continues.  The STS Program has no latitude here;  these
processes are mandated for the entire Foundation.</li>

<li>If you encounter any difficulties with submitting reviews, please contact
me at the addresses below.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Let me close with a word of thanks to all reviewers.  And let me also
encourage anyone who has a question  about the Program's scope, its
activities, or its processes, to contact me or John Perhonins, the Associate
Program Director who handles the dissertation program.  We are always eager
to talk to you about your ideas, your proposals, your plans.  We welcome
queries by telephone or email.  And remember the next target date for
proposals is 1 February 2001.

 3. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION NSF SOCIETAL DIMENSIONS PROGRAM
</p>
<p>
The NSF Societal Dimensions of Engineering, Science, and Technology (SDEST)
program is encouraging proposals for the upcoming February 1, 2001 target
date .  The Societal Dimensions program includes Ethics and Values Studies
(EVS) and Research on Science and Technology (RST).  EVS focuses on
improving knowledge of ethical and value dimensions in science, engineering,
and technology.  RST focuses on improving approaches and information for
decision making about investment in science, engineering, and technology.
</p>
<p>
SDEST considers proposals that examine the full range of questions that
arise in the interactions of science, technology, and society.  It provides
a home at NSF for research on the ethical, legal, economic, and political
contexts for knowledge production and innovation.  EVS is particularly
interested in analysis of ethical questions surrounding new developments in
biotechnology and information technology and of the value issues associated
with social and individual choices concerning them.  RST is particularly
interested in projects that examine the implications of strategies for
research support, and the outcomes of those strategies.  Both program
components are interested in the area of research ethics.  For EVS, this is
a core concern.  For RST, issues of research ethics that have implications
for research productivity and outcomes are important.
</p>
<p>
The SDEST announcement (NSF99-82) can be accessed at
http://www.nsf.gov:80/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf9982; suggestions for applicants and
information about prior awards are available at
