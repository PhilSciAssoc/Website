1.      CALL FOR APPLICATIONS:  Philosophy of Biology Graduate
Training Workshop, San Francisco, Sept. 23-26, 2004.  Deadline July 14.  http://www.ishpssb.org/workshop2004/


</p>
<p>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN THE HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY, AND SOCIAL STUDIES OF
BIOLOGY WORKSHOP.


</p>
<p>
A
Philosophy of Biology Graduate Training Workshop is being held in San
  Francisco, September
 23-26, 2004.  The 2004
ISHPSSB Future Directions Workshop (FDISH) will be an excellent opportunity for
graduate students, advanced undergraduates, post-docs and young faculty
interested in philosophy of biology. We have an interactive schedule planned
with great faculty participants, and hope that you will strongly encourage
those in your department with a professional interest in philosophy of biology
to apply to attend our workshop.
</p>
<p>
FDISH is structured around four invited speakers, various small-group
roundtable discussions, practical workshops, and planned, but informal,
meetings with faculty from around the greater San Francisco Bay Area and
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
The workshop features talks by Jay Odenbaugh (Lewis
and Clark College), Jason Robert (Arizona State University), Kim Sterelny (The Australian National University and Victoria
University, Wellington), and Edna Suárez Diaz
(Universidad Nacional Autónoma
de México), as well as other faculty participants.
</p>
<p>
The application deadline is July 14th, so please get those applications in as
soon as possible! Furthermore, we have funds available for graduate student
travel reimbursement (though students must be ISHPSSB members to qualify).
Please apply online: http://www.ishpssb.org/workshop2004/registration.htm
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions about our workshop, please
do not hesitate to write me. Below I have attached a flyer that can be posted
to advertise our workshop, I would appreciate it if you could print it out and
post where appropriate.
</p>
<p>
The philosophy of biology is intertwined closely with the history and sociology
of biology, and so graduate training in these areas should also be integrated.
As such, FDISH has invited and seeks scholars and graduate students of these,
and other, disciplines to join us.

     2.  ANNOUNCEMENT:  Memberships in the School of Historical Studies for the
academic
           year 2005-2006, Institute for
Advance Study, Princeton, NJ


</p>
<p>
THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY was founded in 1930 as a
community of scholars in which intellectual inquiry can be carried out in the
most favorable circumstances.  It
provides Members with libraries, offices, seminar and lecture rooms, subsidized
restaurant and housing facilities and some secretarial and word-processing
services.


</p>
<p>
THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES supports scholarship in all
fields of historical research, but is concerned principally with the history of
western, near eastern and far eastern civilizations, with particular emphasis
upon Greek and Roman civilization, the history of Europe (medieval, early modern,
and modern), the Islamic world, East Asian studies, the history of art, and
modern international relations.  The
School also offers the Edward T. Cone Membership in Music Studies. Qualified
candidates of any nationality are invited to apply for memberships.  Residence in Princeton during term
time is required.  The only other
obligation of Members is to pursue their own research.  If they wish, Members may participate in
seminars and meetings both within the Institute and at nearby universities, and
there are ample opportunities for contacts with other scholars.


</p>
<p>
Approximately forty Members are appointed for either one or two
terms each year.  The Ph.D. (or
equivalent) and substantial publications are required of all candidates at the
time of application.  Member awards are
funded by the Institute for Advanced Study or by other sources, including the
National Endowment for the Humanities and the Thyssen
Foundation.


</p>
<p>
APPLICATION may be made for one or two terms (September to
December, January to April).  Further
information and application materials may be found on the School's web site, www.hs.ias.edu, or they can be obtained from the
Administrative Officer, School of Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced
Study, Einstein Drive, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 (electronic mail address:
mzelazny@ias.edu).  Completed
applications must be returned to the Administrative Officer by 15 November 2004.


</p>
<p>
OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES


</p>
<p>
MELLON FELLOWSHIPS FOR ASSISTANT PROFESSORS are also offered
each year to two qualified Assistant Professors.  These full-year memberships are designed
specifically for assistant professors at universities and colleges in the United States and Canada to support promising young scholars who have embarked on
professional careers.  Applicants must
have served at least two, and not more than four years as assistant professors
in institutions of higher learning in the United States or Canada and must have approval to return to their institution following
the period of membership.  Stipends will
match the combined salary and benefits at the Member's home institution at the
time of application, and all the privileges of membership at the Institute for
Advanced Study will apply.  Application
materials are the same as for membership, and can be obtained from the web at
www.hs.ias.edu, or by contacting the Administrative Officer at the address
above.


</p>
<p>
ACLS/FREDERICK BURKHARDT FELLOWSHIPS FOR RECENTLY TENURED
SCHOLARS:


</p>
<p>
In the academic year 2005-2006 the Institute for Advanced Study
will again take part in a program sponsored by the American Council of Learned
Societies, the Frederick Burkhardt Fellowships. These
fellowships support more adventurous, more wide-ranging, and longer-term
patterns of research than are current in the humanities and related social
sciences. Depending on the availability of funds, ACLS will provide fellowships
for up to eleven recently tenured faculty, most of
whom will spend a year at one of several residential research centers,
including the Institute for Advanced Study. A scholar applying for the academic
year 2005-2006 must normally have begun her/his tenured contract at a U.S. institution no earlier than the fall 2000 semester or quarter.
Applicants must submit a research plan, typically covering a three to five year
period; one of the first three years of research could be spent as a Member at
the Institute, either in the School of Historical Studies or the School of Social
  Science.


</p>
<p>
Qualified candidates who would like to apply under the auspices
of this program should visit the ACLS website, http://www.acls.org/burkguid.htm,
for a more detailed description of the terms of the fellowship and information
about how to apply. Applications for this program must be submitted through the
ACLS Online Fellowship Application system (OFA) no later than 9 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, September 30, 2004.  OFA is accessible at http://ofa.acls.org or through the ACLS
website.  Information about this program
may also be obtained from the ACLS Fellowships Office, 633 Third Avenue, 8th floor, New
  York, NY 10017-6795.

     3. FELLOWSHIPS: The Duke University Center for Philosophy of
Biology


</p>
<p>
The Duke University Center for Philosophy of
Biology announces the availability of up to three National Science Foundation
Sponsored Graduate Fellowships in the philosophy of biology each year for the
next three years. Qualified students who apply to the Duke graduate programs in
Philosophy and in Biology will be considered for these awards. NSF Philosophy
of Biology Fellows will work with faculty and post-docs in the Center,
undertake the graduate certificate in philosophy of biology, and participate in
shaping and delivering the annual Duke Philosophy fog Biology Spring
Conference. Students from underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to
apply.
</p>
<p>
The Duke Philosophy of Biology Center also announces that
Marshall Abrams, Ph. D. U of Chicago, currently at Colgate University, will be its first NSF
