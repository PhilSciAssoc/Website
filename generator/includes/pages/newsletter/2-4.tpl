</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The
newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to
members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings of the Association, and information
about other meetings likely to be of interest to a broad range of the
membership.  It is NOT intended for ungoing discussions of intellectual
topics within philosophy of science.  If you have information that you
would like to submit for possible inclusion in a future issue of the
newsletter, please send it to the editor at psa@twinearth.wustl.edu.

2. Important Information about PSA 1996
</p>
<p>
Conference and hotel registration information for the upcoming PSA meeting
was sent out under the cover of the History of Science Society.  This may
have caused some people not to take notice of this very time sensitive
material.  Accordingly, I have included the hotel informance and
conference registration form below as items 3 and 4.  They are also
available on the PSA 1996 web page (where it is easy to print out just the
relevant information), together with valuable information about Cleveland
from Lindley Darden and Keith Benson.
</p>
<p>
The url for the PSA 1996 is:
http://www.inform.umd.edu:8080/EdRes/Colleges/ARHU/Depts/chps
This page is provided by the Center for History and Philosophy of Science
at the University of Maryland, and contains a direct link to the PSA
pages.  They in turn include a great deal of information about the
upcoming conference, including the program.

6. Conference on Naturalism, Theism and the Scientific Enterprise
</p>
<p class="center">
CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
(Revised 8/27/96)<br />
Naturalism, Theism and the Scientific Enterprise<br />
An Interdisciplinary Conference at the University of Texas -- Austin<br />
Feb. 20-23, 1997
</p>
<p>
Sponsored by the UT Philosophy Dept.  Invited speakers include Michael Ruse
(Philosophy, University of Guelph, author of Darwinism Defended), Alvin
Plantinga (Philosophy, University of Notre Dame, author of Warrant and
Proper Function), Frederick Grinnell (UT Southwestern Medical Center,
author of The Scientific Attitude), and Phillip Johnson (Law School,
UC-Berkeley, author of Darwin on Trial and Reason in the Balance).
</p>
<p>
The conference is dedicated to fostering dialogue between naturalists and
theists on the impact of social and philosophical predispositions on the
development, interpretation and presentation of scientific knowledge.  Our
goal is to have a program balanced between defenders and critics of
naturalism in science.
</p>
<p>
We encourage submissions from all of the natural sciences, as well as from
philosophy, history and sociology of science.  Suggested topics:
</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Does the scientific method exclude appeals to supernatural agency?</li>
<li>Is there a distinction between methodological and ontological naturalism?</li>
<li>What do case studies in the history of science reveal about the role of
naturalism or theism in advancing or retarding the progress of science?</li>
<li>Does the plausibility of Darwinism and of naturalistic theories of the
origin of life depend on a prior commitment to naturalism?  Can the
scientific merits of naturalistic and theistic explanations be compared?</li>
<li>Can theistic (directed) evolution or the appeal to cosmic design be
testable scientific hypotheses?  If so, does the available evidence weigh
for or against such conjectures?</li>
<li>Is there a demarcation line between science and theology?  Are "natural
theology" and "theistic science" oxymorons?</li>
<li>What social, political and educational factors influence the direction of
research and the presentation of science to the public?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Abstracts should be less than 500 words and should be submitted
electronically to Prof. Robert Koons (koons@phil.utexas.edu) in one of the
following formats:
</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>RTF or ASCII</li>
<li>PostScript</li>
<li>LaTeX</li>
</ul>
<p>
Deadlines:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nov. 1 -- submission of abstracts</li>
<li>Dec. 1 -- notification of authors</li>
<li>Jan. 15 -- submission of full papers</li>

7. Metascience
</p>
<p>
John Forge is now editor of Metascience. Metascience is a review journal
which covers the fields that comprise the disciplines of History and
Philosophy of Science, and Technology and Science, Technology and Society.
The scope of the journal is indicated by its contents and by the fields
attributed to the members of the editorial board. If you are a publisher,
or someone who has written a book which falls within the scope of the
journal, we would welcome a copy for review. We cannot guarantee a full
review, but every book received which comes within the scope of the
journal will get some notice. Metascience does not accept unsolicited
reviews; but if you would like to review for Metascience, please contact
the editor. The normal procedure is for the members of the board to
commission reviews, while the editor is responsible for overall
organisation and for the final acceptance of material for publication.
