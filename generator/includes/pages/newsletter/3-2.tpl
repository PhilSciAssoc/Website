Subject: 1. EDITOR'S NOTE:
</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The
newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to
members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings of the Association, and information
about other meetings likely to be of interest to a broad range of the
membership.  It is NOT intended for ungoing discussions of intellectual
topics within philosophy of science.  If you have information that you
would like to submit for possible inclusion in a future issue of the
newsletter, please send it to the editor at psa@twinearth.wustl.edu.

2. PSA 1998 CALL FOR PAPERS
</p>
<p>
Members of the PSA are invited to submit papers to be presented at the
1998 PSA meeting in Kansas City, October 21-24.  Contributed papers may be
on any topic in the philosophy of science, but in addition to inviting
papers in traditional, core areas of the philosophy of science, the
Program Committee wants also to encourage the submission of proposals in
areas where the philosophy of science engages social issues in science or
issues in science policy.  The deadline for submissions will be February
1, 1998.  The Program Committee expects to make its decisions by April
15, 1998.
</p>
<p>
In a departure from past practice, contributed papers accepted for
presentation at the meeting will not be published before the meeting.
Instead, after the meeting the Program Committee will make a selection of
contributed papers for publication in a supplemental issue of Philosophy
of Science.  Papers whose authors so wish will be made available prior to
the meeting on the PSA 1998 web site (http://scistud.umkc.edu/psa98) and
abstracts of all papers accepted for presentation will be published in an
expanded meeting program.
</p>
<p>
The maximum recommended manuscript length is 5,000 words, including
footnotes and references.  If the text includes tables or figures, an
appropriate number of words should be subtracted from the limit.
Submissions must include a 100-word abstract and a word count.  Format and
citation style should match those of the journal, Philosophy of Science
(see a recent issue for details).  Since papers will be blind refereed,
the author's name, institutional affiliation, surface and email addresses,
and fax and telephone numbers should appear only on a separate cover
letter or cover sheet.  Submissions will be accepted in hard copy by
regular mail, by fax, or in electronic form by email, although email
submissions will be accepted only if sent as attachments in a standard
word-processor format, such as WordPerfect or Microsoft Word.
</p>
<p>
Authors of accepted papers are expected to present abbreviated versions of
their papers, with a time limit of approximately twenty minutes (plus
discussion) and to submit a final manuscript (perhaps incorporating
revisions based upon discussion at the meeting) shortly after the meeting
for consideration for publication.
</p>
<p>
The Program Committee for PSA 1998 is as follows: Robert Brandon (Duke
University), James Cushing (University of Notre Dame), John Dupr
(University of Exeter and Birkbeck College, University of London), Marc
Lange (University of Washington), Lynn Hankinson Nelson (Rowan College of
New Jersey), Kristin Shrader-Frechette (University of South Florida), and
John Worrall (London School of Economics).

3. PSA 1998 CHANGE OF MEETING DATES
</p>
<p>
The Philosophy of Science Association's Governing Board has decided to
make a slight change in the meeting dates for the 1998 meeting.  In
recent years, it has been customary for the PSA Biennial Meeting to
occupy two and one-half days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning, with
registration beginning on Thursday evening.  For the 1998 meeting, we
will shift to a format in which the meeting will occupy three full days,
Thursday, October 22, through Saturday, October 24.  Registration will
begin on Wednesday evening, October 21.  This change will permit a modest
expansion of the program and it will allow those whose travel plans
require an early Sunday morning flight to depart without having to miss
any Sunday morning conference sessions.
