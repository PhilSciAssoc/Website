1.    PSA Election results.
</p>
<p>
The votes from the recent election have
been tabulated, with the following results
President: Lawrence Sklar, Michigan
</p>
<p>
Governing Board:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary Morgan, London School of Economics (re-elected)</li>
<li>Ellery Eells, University of Wisconsin-Madison</li>
<li>Noretta Koertge, Indiana University</li>
<li>Wolfgang Spohn, Universität Konstanz</li>
</ul>
<p>
The slate this year was very competitive and the results were quite close. I
congratulate the new officers, and thank all of  the candidates for their
participation: the PSA  completely depends upon its elected officers to keep it
running well and truly. It's not the easiest thing in the world running for
office, but it's an essential part of our Association's well-being.

 4.   JOB:  Postdoctoral Fellow, Amherst College, Law and Science. Deadline:
March 25, 2005.
</p>
<p>
Amherst College seeks a postdoctoral fellow for a two-year
appointment as a visiting assistant professor in the field of law and science.
The fellow will teach one course per semester, and the rest of the time will be
divided between curricular development and his/her own research. We welcome
inquiries from candidates who have done graduate work in the social, historical,
or philosophical studies of science and technology, as well as from scientists
or legal scholars with special expertise in the role of science in law or the
role of law in science. We are interested, among other things, in how knowledge
practices in law are shaped by science and in the ways knowledge practices in
the sciences are shaped by law. In addition, we are interested in how scientific
institutions incorporate, respond to, and resist the external constraints
imposed by law. Examples of courses that might be taught include:
DNA: Scientific Revolution and Its Legal
Impact; The Science of Forensics; Evidentiary Processes in Law and Science;
Intellectual Property, Biotechnology, and Society; and Privacy and Property in
the Internet Age.
</p>
<p>

Candidates should submit a letter of application explaining the relation of
their research and teaching interests to this position, a curriculum vitae,
sample syllabi for undergraduate courses, and a sample of written work (an
article or chapter, e.g.). Candidates should also arrange for three letters of
recommendation to be sent directly to the Search Committee. All application
materials should be sent to Professor John W. Servos, Search Committee in Law
and Science, Department of History, Amherst College, Amherst MA 01002. Closing
date for applications is March 25, 2005.
</p>
<p>
Amherst College is an undergraduate liberal arts college for men
and women, with 1,600 students and 190 faculty members. Located in the

</p>
<p>
As part of
our continuing investigation in the epistemological features of normative claims
and their role in technological setting, we present a conference on Norms,
Reasoning and Knowledge in Technology.  Invited
speakers will discuss the relationship between various facets of technological
knowledge and reasoning and related norms, with special emphasis on the
relationship between practical reasoning and functional ascriptions.
</p>
<p>
The conference features a diverse and distinguished panel of speakers interested
in the normative aspects of technological knowledge and the relationship between
practical reasoning and artifactual knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Space is limited so we ask that you apply for attendance early.  Email NiK-conf@tm.tue.nl
and please state your affiliations and interests in philosophy of technology.
Please also indicate if you are willing to be a designated respondent during the
conference.

6.   CALL FOR PAPERS:  Interactivist Summer
Institute 2005, September 19-23, 2005.
       Madren Conference Center Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina,
USA.
</p>
<p>
Join us in exploring the frontiers of understanding of life, mind, and
cognition. There is a growing recognition - across many disciplines - that
phenomena of life and mind, including cognition and representation, are
emergents of far-from-equilibrium, interactive, autonomous systems. Mind and
biology, mind and agent, are being re-united. The classical treatment of
cognition and representation within a formalist framework of encodingist
assumptions is widely recognized as a fruitless maze of blind alleys. From
neurobiology to robotics, from cognitive science to philosophy of mind and
language, dynamic and interactive alternatives are being explored. Dynamic
systems approaches and autonomous agent research join in the effort.
</p>
<p>
The interactivist model offers a theoretical approach to matters of life and
mind, ranging from evolutionary- and neuro-biology - including the emergence of
biological function - through representation, perception, motivation, memory,
learning and development, emotions, consciousness, language, rationality,
sociality, personality and psychopathology. This work has developed interfaces
with studies of central nervous system functioning, the ontology of process,
autonomous agents, philosophy of science, and all areas of psychology,
philosophy, and cognitive science that address the person.
</p>
<p>
The conference will involve both tutorials addressing central parts and aspects
of the interactive model, and papers addressing current work of relevance to
this general approach. This will be our third Summer Institute; the first was in
2001 at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA, and the second was in 2003 in
Copenhagen, Denmark. The intention is for this Summer Institute to become a
traditional biennial meeting where those sharing the core ideas of interactivism
will meet and discuss their work, try to reconstruct its historical roots, put
forward current research in different fields that fits the interactivist
framework, and define research topics for prospective graduate students. People
working in philosophy of mind, linguistics, social sciences, artificial
intelligence, cognitive robotics, theoretical biology, and other fields related
to the sciences of mind are invited to send their paper submission or statement
of interest for participation to the organizers.
