<p>
PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES ON SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING
</p>
<p>
Thursday 25 August - Saturday 27 August, 2005
Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam , The Netherlands
</p>
<p>
This conference centers around the theme of 'scientific understanding'. The notion of scientific understanding is closely related to that of scientific explanation, but while explanation is widely discussed in philosophy of science, not much work has focused explicitly on understanding. One reason is that traditional philosophers of science have long regarded it as 'merely' a psychological notion, and thereby as philosophically irrelevant. This attitude, however, is slowly disappearing, and interest in the topic of understanding is growing. With this conference we hope to stimulate the
development of philosophical research into scientific understanding.
</p>
<p>
The conference is intended for philosophers of science working on the topic of scientific understanding itself, or on related topics such as explanation, modeling, representation, etc.; and for historians and sociologists of science, cognitive scientists, and others having an interest in philosophical questions regarding scientific understanding.
</p>

CALL FOR PAPERS:
We welcome contributed papers, which will be programmed in parallel sessions (45-60 minute presentation including discussion). We aim at a varied programme, in which philosophical questions about the nature of scientific understanding will be approached in different ways. In addition to contributions of a general philosophical nature, we hope to be able to present studies focused on a wide range of sciences, both natural and social. Although the conference has a philosophical orientation, contributions by historians and sociologists of science, cognitive scientists, and others, are welcome, as long as they are relevant to the general philosophical theme.
</p>
<p>
Possible topics are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The relation between explanation and understanding in science</li>
<li>Understanding and types of scientific explanation (causal, mechanistic, functional, unifying, etc.).</li>
<li>Is understandingepistemic, pragmatic, or both?</li>
<li>Models, analogies, and intelligibility</li>
<li>Cognitive science and scientific understanding</li>
<li>Is understandingindividual or social?</li>
<li>Understanding in the various sciences: similarities and differences</li>
<li>Case studies from the practice and history of science</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please send an abstract of 450 words, and full contact information, to: understanding@ph.vu.nl

4. SUMMER SCHOOL: Konstanz , Germany : Philosophy, Probability and Physics.
Application deadline: April 15 2005 . www.uni-konstanz.de/ppm/summerschool2005/
</p>
<p>
International Summer School<br />
Philosophy, Probability and Physics<br />
University of Konstanz<br />
August 7-13, 2005
</p>
<p>
Probability is not only a key concept in many branches of physics, but has also been attracting the attention from philosophers. For example, probabilities play a crucial role in quantum mechanics and its interpretations. Also, the concept of probability has continually been at the center of philosophical debate in the foundations of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. Recent developments in quantum information theory have reinvigorated philosophical interest in probabilities.
</p>
<p>
This summer school is geared to doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers in philosophy of physics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of probability, as well as philosophically minded physicists. We aim tobring this group together with leading experts on probability in physical theories. Our method will be to use probabilities as a leitmotif through different subjects in the philosophy of physics and to analyze the concept of probability from different theoretical viewpoints: probability in thermodynamics, statistical physics, quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, as well as space time theories. Experts will give lectures on each of these topics. Our mainlecturers are C. Callender, D. Dieks , D. Duerr, R .
Frigg, C. Fuchs, T. Maudlin and I. Pitowsky .
</p>
<p>
The summer school is being organized by Claus Beisbart ( University of Konstanz) and Stephan Hartmann ( Universityof Konstanzand LSE).
