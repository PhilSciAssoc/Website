5. Positions at NSF
</p>
<p>
The Division of Science Resources Studies (SRS) of the National
Science Foundation, is advertising to fill at least two positions in
the near future.  This is the division that has responsibility for
collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data on the enterprise of
science and engineering in the U.S. (education and employment of
scientists and engineers, spending on research and development in all
sectors of the economy, public attitudes towards science, outcomes of
science and engineering...).  These positions are for analysts in the
division, to work with large scale survey data examining policy issues
in science and engineering and overseeing the development of
particular surveys.  The positions vary in terms of the relative
balance between analysis and survey oversight and development.
However, over time, a broad variety of activities and opportunities
will be available for new members of our staff.
</p>
<p>
SRS is a very exciting place to work for people interested in
quantitative social science research.  These particular positions have
a great deal of career-building potential and should be of great
interest to nearly completed- or recent-PhDs in the social sciences,
or for young people with comparable experience.  SRS, and NSF more
generally, is particularly searching to hire a staff that reflects the
nation's diverse population.  Copies of the vacancy announcements that
explain what the general duties and responsibilities will be, what
factors applications will be ranked on, and how to apply are avilable
on the NSF Homepage, at http://www.nsf.gov/home/chart/start.htm, under
Vacancies, then under Scientific and Professional.  The SRS Homepage,
that gives a good deal of information about the scope of work at SRS,
is at http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs.  Interested applicants should be
sure to read the entire announcement carefully, as incomplete
applications are not looked upon favorably by government personnel
offices!
</p>
<p>
You will note that there are two vacancy announcements; these are for
exactly the same positions, but reflect two ways that NSF hires staff
- either as excepted service positions (AD-2) or as general service
positions (GS-11/12/13).  These distinctions should not be important
at this point in the process; if someone is interested we will discuss
them at an appropriate time.  The salary level we hire at will depend
on the experience and qualifications of the applicant, but it ranges
from $39,270 to $72,758.
</p>
<p>
Potential applicants who have any questions about these positions or
how to apply may call Jeanne E. Griffith at 703-306-1785, or send an
email to jgriffit@nsf.gov.

6. Memberships in the School of Historical Studies
</p>
<p>
INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, Princeton, New Jersey
</p>
<p>
ANNOUNCEMENT OF MEMBERSHIPS IN THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES
for the academic year 1999 - 2000
</p>
<p>
THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY was founded in 1930 as a community of
scholars in which intellectual inquiry can be carried out in the most
favorable circumstances.  It provides Members and Visitors with
libraries, offices, seminar and lecture rooms, subsidized restaurant and
housing facilities and some secretarial and word-processing services.
</p>
<p>
THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES  is concerned principally with the
history of western and near eastern civilization, with particular
emphasis upon Greek and Roman civilization, the history of Europe,
Islamic culture, the history of art and the history of modern
international relations.    In addition to these fields, in the academic
year 1999 - 2000 the School of Historical Studies will support three
Members in the history and culture of traditional China. Qualified
candidates of any nationality specializing in these fields are invited
to apply for memberships.  Apart from residence in Princeton during term
time, the only obligation of visiting Members is to pursue their own
research.  If they wish, however, Members may participate in seminars
and meetings both within the Institute and at nearby universities, and
there are ample opportunities for contacts with other scholars.
</p>
<p>
Approximately forty visiting Members are appointed each year.  The Ph.D.
(or equivalent) and substantial publications are required of all
candidates at the time of application.  Member awards are funded by the
Institute for Advanced Study or by other sources, including the National
Endowment for the Humanities whose support will enable three U.S.
citizens to take up full-year memberships in the academic year
1999-2000.
</p>
<p>
APPLICATION may be made for one or two terms (September to December,
January to April).  Further information and application materials may be
obtained from the Administrative Officer, School of Historical Studies,
Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 (electronic
mail address: mzelazny@ias.edu).   Completed applications must be
returned to the Administrative Officer by 15 November 1998.
</p>
<p>
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES
</p>
<p>
MELLON FELLOWSHIPS FOR ASSISTANT PROFESSORS are also offered each year
to two qualified Assistant Professors.  These full year memberships are
designed specifically for assistant professors at universities and
colleges in the United States and Canada to support promising young
scholars who have embarked on professional careers.  Applicants must
have served at least two, and not more than four years as assistant
professors in institutions of higher learning in the United States or
Canada, and must have approval to return to their institution following
the period of membership.  Stipends will match the combined salary and
benefits at the Member's home institution, and all the privileges of
membership at the Institute for Advanced Study will apply.  Qualified
applicants may apply for one type of membership only.  No dual
applications will be accepted.  For additional information and
application forms contact the Administrative Officer at the address
above.
