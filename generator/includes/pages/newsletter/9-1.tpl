1.
PSA Election Results, reported
by George Gale.



The
results of our recent election have been tabulated. They are:

President Elect: Brian Skyrms

Governing Board:

James Woodward
David Malament
Jeremy Butterfield
Mary Morgan

Since Woodward, Malament and Butterfield are incumbents, this present term is
their last one (for now!); it will endure until 31 Dec '04.

There was a good turnout: 197  ballots were
submitted (compared to 105/2001 and 109/2000). Looks like
including a self-addressed envelope is worth it.

The vast majority of ballots came in during the last week in December; there
were 31 ballots from overseas.

Good show!

     5.  BRITISH
SOCIETY FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
          PRESIDENT'S PRIZE FOR A TEXTBOOK IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 2003

The Society announces the establishment of a biennial prize for an outstanding
new textbook in the philosophy of science. The aim of the award is to recognise excellence and innovation in the promotion of
philosophy of science to broader academic audiences. It may be shared, and may
also be withheld if there are no clearly deserving candidates. The total
monetary value of the prize is £1,000 for each round of the competition.

Books nominated for the award must (i) be in English
(originally or in translation); (ii) have clear potential for classroom use at
undergraduate level; (iii) have been published no earlier than January 1, 2000. Edited volumes or new
editions of existing texts may be considered in exceptional cases.

Books may be nominated by any member of the BSPS, except their author. Nominations
should consist of a one-page statement outlining the primary merits of the
text. Supporting material such as published reviews may be attached if
appropriate. Nominations should be sent to the address below by June 30 2003. A shortlist of
nominated titles will be drawn up by members of the Committee of the Society,
and then forwarded to members of a panel drawn from the Past Presidents of the
Society. The winner will be announced at the Annual General Meeting of the
Society in June 2004.

Quantum Theory: reconsideration of foundations-2.  International
Conference:  2003:  June 1-6,
International Center for
Mathematical Modeling [in physics, technique and cognitive
sciences],  Vaxjo
  University,  Sweden.


http://www.msi.vxu.se/aktuellt/konferens/Quantum.pdf
Supported by EU-network: &quot;Quantum Probability and Applications.&quot;

The main aim of this Conference is to reconsider foundations of quantum
theory.  The following problems will be discussed during the Conference:



1). Analysis of
the creation of the quantum formalism: quantum probability;
quantum logic, quantum information.
2). Interpretations of wave function, relation to foundations of probability
theory. Superposition principle.
3). Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment. Bell's
inequality: realism/nonlocality/contextualism?
4) Quantum information and teleportation, computing and cryptography:
Shannon meets Bohr:  Quantum Foundations in the Light
of Quantum Information
5) Pilot-wave theory, nonlocality. De
Broglie double-solution theory.
6) Local realistic models, hidden variables.
7) Quantum mechanics: a perculiarity of nature or
just a special statistical method
of  the description of nature?
8) Evidences of violations of quantum mechanical description?
9). Contextual approach to quantum probability
10) Discrete deterministic quantum models.



The Conference
will start at 1 June (Sunday), arrival 31 May (Saturday) ;
and  lectures will finish at
13.00, 6 June.

Abstract ,1 page + application form can be found at
conference homepage. All possible questions to our secretary: to: cecilia.eriksson@msi.vxu.se  It would be nice to

GRADUATE PROGRAMME in philosophy and economics.



The Erasmus Institute for
Philosophy and Economics (EIPE) invites students to apply for its GRADUATE
PROGRAMME in philosophy and economics, preferably before February 1, 2003
(later applications will be considered on a first come, first serve basis). The
focus of the programme is on interdisciplinary areas where the Philosophy and
Methodology of Economics, on the one hand, and Institutional Economics, on the
other, meet (with particular attention paid to the new developments in science
studies and to the new economics of institutions and organizations).

The programme is strongly international. Its working language is English.

Ideally, applicants have a Master's degree in economics or in philosophy, or are
close to completing such a degree. Those with a strong Bachelor's degree will
also be considered.

The programme is in two parts. The first part provides a one-year MPhil Degree and it can be done separately. It consists of
a set of foundational courses on topics that range from the philosophy and
rhetoric of both mainstream and heterodox economics to the foundations of new
institutional and evolutionary economics. The core courses are currently given
by Mark Blaug, John Groenewegen,
Arjo Klamer, Uskali Maki, Deirdre McCloskey and Jack Vromen
as well as visiting professors (such as, in 2000-2002, by Gregory Dow, Wade
Hands, John Davis, Claude Menard, and John Dupre).

Overall, EIPE has some 20 Members who participate in its activities, including
teaching, and whose areas of expertise cover a broad range of fields and
topics, from philosophy of science, social epistemology, social ontology, and
internet ethics to theories of rationality, transaction cost economics,
organization theory, game theory, and cultural economics (the current list of
members comprises Gerrit Antonides,
Mark Blaug, John Davis, Igor Douven,
Sanjeev Goyal, John Groenewegen, George Hendrikse, Jeroen van den Hoven, Maarten Janssen, Arjo Klamer, Barbara Krug, Theo Kuipers,
Deirdre McCloskey, Uskali Maki, Bart Nooteboom, Paivi Oinas, Laszlo Polos, Ruth Towse, Jack Vromen, Richard
Whitley, Theo van Willigenburg).

The MPhil will be useful for those who want to have a
solid introduction to the areas covered; those who want to upgrade their
knowledge close to the frontline research on these themes; and those who want
to prepare themselves for PhD research at EIPE or elsewhere.

After the MPhil, students can apply for the second
part of the EIPE Programme, the PhD programme. PhD theses focus on topics
related to the EIPE Research Programme &quot;Institutions&quot;.

EIPE organizes a regular research seminar with internationally renowned experts
presenting papers. It also runs a PhD seminar to provide a forum for discussion
of the work in progress by its graduate students. Moreover, it organises international workshops and conferences on a wide
range of topics.

For more information about the institute, the graduate programme, and application
procedures see our web site: http://www.eur.nl/fw/philecon/
or contact the secretary of the institute, Loes van Dijk (vandijk@fwb.eur.nl,
