PSA Election Results, reported
by George Gale.

</p>
<p>

The
results of our recent election have been tabulated. They are:
</p>
<p>
President Elect: Brian Skyrms
</p>
<p>
Governing Board:
</p>
<ul>
<li>James Woodward</li>
<li>David Malament</li>
<li>Jeremy Butterfield</li>
<li>Mary Morgan</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since Woodward, Malament and Butterfield are incumbents, this present term is
their last one (for now!); it will endure until 31 Dec '04.
</p>
<p>
There was a good turnout: 197  ballots were
submitted (compared to 105/2001 and 109/2000). Looks like
including a self-addressed envelope is worth it.
</p>
<p>
The vast majority of ballots came in during the last week in December; there
were 31 ballots from overseas.
</p>
<p>
Good show!

<p>
Books nominated for the award must (i) be in English
(originally or in translation); (ii) have clear potential for classroom use at
undergraduate level; (iii) have been published no earlier than January 1, 2000. Edited volumes or new
editions of existing texts may be considered in exceptional cases.
</p>

GRADUATE PROGRAMME in philosophy and economics.

</p>
<p>

The Erasmus Institute for
Philosophy and Economics (EIPE) invites students to apply for its GRADUATE
PROGRAMME in philosophy and economics, preferably before February 1, 2003
(later applications will be considered on a first come, first serve basis). The
focus of the programme is on interdisciplinary areas where the Philosophy and
Methodology of Economics, on the one hand, and Institutional Economics, on the
other, meet (with particular attention paid to the new developments in science
studies and to the new economics of institutions and organizations).
</p>
<p>
The programme is strongly international. Its working language is English.
</p>
<p>
Ideally, applicants have a Master's degree in economics or in philosophy, or are
close to completing such a degree. Those with a strong Bachelor's degree will
also be considered.
</p>
<p>
The programme is in two parts. The first part provides a one-year MPhil Degree and it can be done separately. It consists of
a set of foundational courses on topics that range from the philosophy and
rhetoric of both mainstream and heterodox economics to the foundations of new
institutional and evolutionary economics. The core courses are currently given
by Mark Blaug, John Groenewegen,
Arjo Klamer, Uskali Maki, Deirdre McCloskey and Jack Vromen
as well as visiting professors (such as, in 2000-2002, by Gregory Dow, Wade
Hands, John Davis, Claude Menard, and John Dupre).
</p>
<p>
Overall, EIPE has some 20 Members who participate in its activities, including
teaching, and whose areas of expertise cover a broad range of fields and
topics, from philosophy of science, social epistemology, social ontology, and
internet ethics to theories of rationality, transaction cost economics,
organization theory, game theory, and cultural economics (the current list of
members comprises Gerrit Antonides,
Mark Blaug, John Davis, Igor Douven,
Sanjeev Goyal, John Groenewegen, George Hendrikse, Jeroen van den Hoven, Maarten Janssen, Arjo Klamer, Barbara Krug, Theo Kuipers,
Deirdre McCloskey, Uskali Maki, Bart Nooteboom, Paivi Oinas, Laszlo Polos, Ruth Towse, Jack Vromen, Richard
Whitley, Theo van Willigenburg).
</p>
<p>
The MPhil will be useful for those who want to have a
solid introduction to the areas covered; those who want to upgrade their
knowledge close to the frontline research on these themes; and those who want
to prepare themselves for PhD research at EIPE or elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
After the MPhil, students can apply for the second
part of the EIPE Programme, the PhD programme. PhD theses focus on topics
related to the EIPE Research Programme &quot;Institutions&quot;.
</p>
<p>
EIPE organizes a regular research seminar with internationally renowned experts
presenting papers. It also runs a PhD seminar to provide a forum for discussion
of the work in progress by its graduate students. Moreover, it organises international workshops and conferences on a wide
range of topics.
</p>

procedures see our web site: <a href="http://www.eur.nl/fw/philecon/" rel="external">http://www.eur.nl/fw/philecon/</a>
