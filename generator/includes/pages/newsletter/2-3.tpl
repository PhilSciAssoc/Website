3. Special Roundtable at PSA96 on Teaching Philosophy of Science
</p>
<p>
Announcement from Michael Ruse:
</p>
<p>
     Having talked to a number of my fellow philosophers of
science, I realize that I am not alone in worrying increasingly
about the content and quality of my teaching, and not simply
because we are now being pressured by our university authorities
in this area as well as in our research.  I realize also that we
philosophers of science face special challenges, located as we
are between the humanities and the sciences.  On the one hand, we
have a subject which, even at the most elementary levels,
requires at least some acquaintance or background with both
philosophy and an empirical subject.  On the other hand, if an
institution like Guelph is at all typical, we have students who
tend to be less than enthusiastic, frequently from the arts
satisfying a science credit or conversely.
</p>
<p>
     I am therefore organizing an informal roundtable at the
upcoming PSA 96, on the subject of the teaching of the philosophy
of science.  I myself have no particular axe to grind and no
personal agenda, hidden or otherwise.  I invite people who are
interested in participating or just attending to contact me,
with suggestions for contributions, offers of participation, or
anything else which they think relevant, and on the basis of
responses I will draw up a brief programme.  I particularly urge
people who think that they have found new or exciting directions
-- the use of film, drawing on the internet, team teaching,
student research projects, or whatever -- to contact me, and I
very much hope that those people who may never usually
participate formally in a PSA but who pride themselves on their
teaching will come forward.
</p>
<p>
     There will be no publications from this session, but I hope
that it will be the beginning of an ongoing process in the PSA.
Hence, I do hope that people will come along with ideas about
ways in which we might develop and disseminate our thinking and
experiences.  I hope also that people who are more comfortable
than I with this new era of electronic information will be
willing to offer their services.  But, until PSA 96, I ask that
people contact me by email, and I will do my best to organize
things and to pass on information.  Since there will be no formal
refereeing or the like, I will assume (unless told otherwise)
that everything is entirely open and non-confidential.

        Conference on the Need for a New Economics of Science<br />
             Conference Announcement and Call for Papers<br />
                   University of Notre Dame<br />
                      March 13-16, 1997<br />

</p>
<p>
Sponsored by: National Science Foundation, John J. Reilly Center for
Science, Technology, and Values, and Office of Graduate Research
</p>
<p>
        Many recent works in science studies have adopted economic or
quasi-economic metaphors for understanding science. Inspired by trends
toward the actual practice and culture of science, many sociologists of
scientific knowledge have come up with stories about interests, action,
and exchange that look like the product of economic analysis. However,
these metaphors are generally not fully elaborated. Motivated by movements
toward economic perspectives on traditionally non-economic issues, many
economists have started applying the tools of economic analysis to the
behavior of scientists. However, these studies are largely silent about
the influence of these analyses on the content of science. In response to
tendencies toward anti-foundationalism and naturalism, many philosophers
of science have argued that scientific knowledge is constructed out of an
economic process. However, these explanations typically sidestep problems
associated with welfare economics and the assumption of instrumental
rationality in economics. Concomitantly, historians have noted a recent
shift in social support for scientific research and science policy experts
have analyzed issues such as the recent changes in financial support of
science.
</p>
<p>
        The purpose of this conference is to bring together science
studies scholars, economists, philosophers of science, historians, science
policy experts, and scientists in order to start a constructive
dialogue about the promises and problems of alternative economic theories
of the behavior of scientists and comparisons of science to a market.
Particular topics that will be covered are: the intellectual history of
theories of an economics of science, evolving formats of
university/government and university/industry relations, labor economics
perspectives on scientific careers, feminist economics views on science,
the economics of the dissemination and validation of findings, the
conception that science is a public good, the economics of fraud in
science, the causes and consequences of the division of labor in science,
and the economics of intellectual property rights.
</p>

8. Pittsburgh/Konstanz Colloquium on Limits of Science
</p>
<p>
The Center for Philosophy of Science of the University of Pittsburgh and
the Zentrum Philosophie und Wissenschaftstheorie of the Universitaet of
Konstanz (Germany) are planning a conference on THE LIMITS OF SCIENCE to
be held as the 4th Biennial Metting of the Pittsburgh-Konstanz Colloquium.
The Colloquium will take place at the University of Pittsburgh on October
3-6, 1997.  Submissions of contributed papers of 3,000-3,500 words in
English are invited and should be sent by 31 December 1996 to the
Pittsburgh-Konstanz Colloquium, c/o Center for Philosophy of Science,
University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA  15260 or c/o Zentrum Philosophie
und Wissenschaftstheorie, Universitaet Konstanz, Postfach 5560-D15, D78434
Konstanz, Germany.  The range of topics will include (but not necessarily
be confined to) such issues as epistemic limitations of science, moral
limits to scientific research, limits to science's effectiveness as a
guide in human affairs, and limits imposed on scientific understanding by
chance, chaos, and complexity.
