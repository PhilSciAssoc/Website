Subject: 1. EDITOR'S NOTE:
</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by the
Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The newsletter
is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to members of the
Association (e.g., official business of the Association, information about
upcoming meetings of the Association, and information about other meetings
likely to be of interest to a broad range of the membership.  It is NOT
intended for ungoing discussions of intellectual topics within philosophy
of science.  If you have information that you would like to submit for
possible inclusion in a future issue of the newsletter, please send it to the editor at psa@twinearth.wustl.edu.
</p>
<p>
Directions for subscribing and unsubscribing:
<code>Send an email message with NO subject to psa-request@cctr.umkc.edu</code>
To subscribe, include the following as the ONLY line:
        <code>SUBSCRIBE PSA &lt;your name&gt;</code>
To unsubscribe, include the following as the ONLY line:
        <code>UNSUBSCRIBE PSA</code>
</p>
<p>
This is the first newsletter in quite a while.  The reason is simple:  I
publish only when people send us news.  So if you do not receive a
newsletter for some time, the most likely reason is that no one has sent
me any news that that is appropriate for distributing to the membership.

2. Donald T. Campbell, 1916-1996
</p>
<p>
[The following notice of the death of Donald Campbell was prepared by Mark
Bickhard of Lehigh.  As Editor, I simply want to note as well that Don was
a great friend of philosophy of science, and of many of us in the profession.
He supported and challenged many of us individually, and he is responsible
for bringing many of us together with our colleagues in other science
studies disciplines.  As Mark concludes, he is deeply missed.  There will
no doubt be several funds set up in his memory, but one I know of now is
a student research fund at Lehigh University.  Contributions can be sent
to Dr. Judy Lasker, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Price Hall,
Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA  18015]
</p>
<p>
Professor Donald T. Campbell 1916 - 1996<br />
Lehigh University
</p>
<p>
Donald T. Campbell, 79, died May 6, 1996, of complications after
surgery. Don had retired in 1994 as professor of Psychology and of
Sociology and Anthropology at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa.,
but continued active on campus and in his writing until his death. He
encouraged and inspired everyone with his intellectual energy and
enormous interdisciplinary breadth and depth.
</p>
<p>
Don's career was astounding. He was a member of the National
Academy of Sciences since 1973; President of the American
Psychological Association in 1973; member of the American
Philosophical Society since 1993; and recipient of awards and
honorary degrees far too numerous to list here. He authored more
than 250 articles.
</p>
<p>
Don's work is best known in Philosophy for his development of
evolutionary epistemology, an approach to epistemology applicable
at all biological, psychological, and social levels. He is, moreover,
considered to be one of the most influential social psychologists of
the last half century. Don, however, called himself a "dabbler" as he
roamed the fields of philosophy, psychology, sociology, education,
and anthropology. His most recent work was in the sociology of
science, focusing on what he called the sociology of scientific
validity, and the philosophy of science. Among many as yet
unfinished collaborations are an extension of his notion of downward
causation, and an extensive argument that variation and selection is a
general and useful form of explanation not limited to biological
evolution or epistemology.
</p>
<p>
Don was a genius. But his heart was even larger than his intellect. He
was caring and unpretentious. He encouraged and mentored people
all over the world. He was a good friend and a good human being.
He is deeply missed.

4. New Executive Secretary
</p>
<p>
After many years of extraordinary service to PSA, Peter Asquith will soon
be stepping down as Executive Secretary.  The Association owes a great
debt to Peter for his endeavors over the years.  Peter, a note of thanks
is grossly insufficient to recognize all you have done, but it is all I
can offer here.  Thanks also to Christine Kaye for her efforts in your office.
</p>
<p>
The new Executive Secretary will be George Gale of the University of
Missouri, Kansas City.  Congratulations, George!
</p>
<p>
There will be some changes in the operation of the business office.
Details on how it will function will be distributed in a future newsletter.

7. Rockefeller Archive Center Grants
</p>
<p>
For 1997 the Rockefeller Archive Center will have two components to its
program of Grants for Travel and Research at the Rockefeller Archive
Center.  In addition to is regular competitive program that is open to
researchers in any discipline engaged in research that requires use of its
collections, the Center will award up to ten grants to support research on
topics related to the continent of Africa.  The competition for these
targeted grants will use the same application form and follow the same
guidelines as the regular program.  Applicants from within the U.S. and
Canada may request support of up to $1,500; because of the additional cost
of travel, applicants from other nations may request up to $2,000.
applicants wishing to be considered for the special grant program on
Africa should indicate this in a cover letter.  The deadline for
applicants is November 30, 1996; grant recipients will be announced in
March 1997.  For application forms and additional information about the
Archive Center's grant programs, contact the director, Darwin H.
Stapleton, at the Rockefeller Archive Center, 15 Dayton Avenue, North
Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591-1598 or call (914) 631-4505.
