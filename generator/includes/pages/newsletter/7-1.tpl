  1. EDITORIAL: HOW TO IMPROVE THIS NEWSLETTER
     by Malcolm R. Forster
</p>
<p>
Having edited this newsletter for a while, I have some ideas about how to
improve it.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the age of the Internet, it is appropriate that the DETAILS of any
lengthy communication with PSA members should be published on a webpage.
The function of the PSA newsletter would be to advertise the link. In that
way, the newsletter would easier to read, easier to edit, and able to include a
more comprehensive and reliable range of items of interest to PSA members.</li>

  <li>The most essential piece of information for me, as well as for you, is
the DEADLINE associated with a news item (as in the case of calls for papers,
grant and job applications, and so on) . If this were stated in the subject
line
(title) of every item emailed to me for publication, it would be easier for
me to keep track, and less likely that some items with short deadlines are
not published in time (my apologies in the cases where this has happened).</li>

  <li>Every PSA member could provide an important service to other PSA
members by emailing links to mforster@facstaff.wisc.edu (putting PSA, deadline
month/day/year in the title). It is easy for me to copy and paste a brief
description of the link directly from a webpage.</li>

  4. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, Princeton, New Jersey
</p>
<p>
ANNOUNCEMENT OF MEMBERSHIPS IN THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES
      for the academic year 2002-2003
</p>
<p>
THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY was founded in 1930 as a community of
scholars in which intellectual inquiry can be carried out in the most
favorable circumstances.  It provides Members with libraries, offices,
seminar and lecture rooms, subsidized restaurant and housing facilities and
some secretarial and word-processing services.
</p>
<p>
THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES supports scholarship in all fields of
historical research,  including the history and philosophy of science, among
the School's principle areas of interest.  Fields of primary interest also
include the history of western and near eastern civilization, with
particular emphasis upon Greek and Roman civilization, the history of
Europe, the Islamic world, and the history of art.  For the first time the
School is also pleased to announce the Edward T. Cone Membership in Music
Studies, to be offered each year from now on. In addition to these fields,
in the academic year 2002-2003 the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation will support
three Members in East Asian Studies, including linguistics, translation
studies, cultural history, and the emergence of East Asian vernaculars.
Qualified candidates of any nationality are invited to apply for
memberships.  Apart from residence in Princeton during term time, the only
obligation of Members is to pursue their own research.  If they wish,
however, Members may participate in seminars and meetings both within the
Institute and at nearby universities, and there are ample opportunities for
contacts with other scholars.
</p>
<p>
Approximately forty Members are appointed for either one or two terms each
year. The Ph.D. (or equivalent) and substantial publications are required of
all candidates at the time of application.  Member awards are funded by the
Institute for Advanced Study or by other sources, including the National
Endowment for the Humanities, whose support will enable three scholars
(either U.S. citizens, or three-year residents in the U.S.) to take up
full-year memberships, and the Thyssen Foundation which will support two
German citizens.
</p>
<p>
APPLICATION may be made for one or two terms (September to December, January
to April).  Further information and application materials may be found on
the School's web site, www.hs.ias.edu, or they can be obtained from the
Administrative Officer, School of Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced
Study, Einstein Drive, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 (electronic mail address:
mzelazny@ias.edu).  Completed applications must be returned to the
Administrative Officer by 15 November 2001.
</p>
<p>
  OTHER OPPORTUNITIES
</p>
<p>
MELLON FELLOWSHIPS FOR ASSISTANT PROFESSORS are also offered each year to
two qualified Assistant Professors.  These full-year memberships are
designed specifically for assistant professors at universities and colleges
in the United States and Canada to support promising young scholars who have
embarked on professional careers.  Applicants must have served at least two,
and not more than four years as assistant professors in institutions of
higher learning in the United States or Canada and must have approval to
return to their institution following the period of membership.  Stipends
will match the combined salary and benefits at the Member's home institution
at the time of application, and all the privileges of membership at the
Institute for Advanced Study will apply.  Qualified applicants may apply for
one type of membership only.  No dual applications will be accepted.  For
additional information and application forms contact the Administrative
Officer at the address above.
</p>
<p>
ACLS/FREDERICK BURKHARDT FELLOWSHIPS FOR RECENTLY TENURED SCHOLARS:
In the academic year 2002/2003 the Institute for Advanced Study will again
take part in a program sponsored by the American Council of Learned
Societies, the Frederick Burkhardt Fellowships. With the goal of supporting
more adventurous, more wide-ranging, and longer term patterns of research,
the ACLS will provide funding for up to eleven recently tenured faculty in
the Humanities and related Social Sciences, most of whom will spend a year
at one of several residential research centers, including the  Institute for
Advanced Study. A scholar applying for the academic year 2002-2003 must
normally have begun her/his tenured contract at a U.S. or Canadian
institution no earlier than October 1, 1997. Applicants must submit a
research plan, typically covering a three to five year period; one of the
first three years of research could be spent as a Member at the Institute,
either in the School of Historical Studies or the School of Social Science.
Qualified candidates who would like to apply for affiliation with the School
of Historical Studies under the auspices of this program should contact the
ACLS, Fellowships Office, 228 East 45th Street, New York, NY 10017-3398 or
E-mail grants@acls.org for application materials and a more detailed
description of the terms of the fellowship. Applications for this program
should be submitted directly to the ACLS no later than October 1, 2001.

  5. VIENNA INTERNATIONAL SUMMER UNIVERSITY SCIENTIFIC WORLD CONCEPTIONS
</p>
<p>
Beginning in 2001 the University of Vienna and the Institute Vienna Circle
will hold an annual two-week summer program dedicated to major current
issues in the natural and the social sciences, their history and
philosophy. The
title of the program reflects the heritage of the Vienna Circle which
promoted interdisciplinary and philosophical investigations based on solid
disciplinary knowledge.
</p>
<p>
As an international interdisciplinary program, VISU-SWC brings graduate
students in close contact with world-renowned scholars. It operates under
the academic supervision of an International Program Committee of distinguished
philosophers, historians, and scientists. The program is directed primarily
to graduate students and junior researchers in fields related to the annual
topic, but the organizers also encourage applications from gifted
undergraduates and from people in all stages of their career who wish to
broaden their horizon through cross-disciplinary studies of methodological
and foundational issues in science.
</p>
<p>
The first topic is:
</p>
<p>
Unity and Plurality in Science
</p>
<p>
16-28 July 2001
</p>
<p>
Don Howard (University of Notre Dame) and
</p>
