</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The
newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to
members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings of the Association, and information
about other meetings likely to be of interest to a broad range of the
membership.  It is NOT intended for ungoing discussions of intellectual
topics within philosophy of science.  If you have information that you
would like to submit for possible inclusion in a future issue of the
newsletter, please send it to the editor at <a href="mailto:psa@twinearth.wustl.edu" rel="email">psa@twinearth.wustl.edu</a>.

2. NOTICE REGARDING FUNDING FOR HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
</p>
<p>

    Many members of PSA may have heard about proposals in the US
    Congress for eliminating funding for the social sciences
    within NSF.  Such proposals would eliminate funding for
    history and philosophy of science within the NSF.  Inquiries by
    some officers of PSA have determined that this is indeed
    a real possibility and, moreover, that this might happen quite
    quickly within the budget process now in progress, and
    continuing into the summer.  The legal status of PSA prohibits
    the organization from engaging in political lobbying.  Of
    course, members as individuals may take whatever actions they
    deem appropriate.  Organizations, such as The
    Federation of Behavioral, Psychological and Cognitive
    Sciences, are urging their members immediately to contact
    their own representatives and senators regarding this matter.
    More information can be obtained from The Federation: e-mail
    <a href="mailto:federation@apa.org" rel="email">federation@apa.org</a>; fax (202) 336-6158; telephone (202)
    336-5920.

Foundation, and representing NSF in the STS research community.  Broad
