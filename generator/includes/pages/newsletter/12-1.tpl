Outline and Research Questions:
</p>
<p>
Computer simulations play a crucial role in many sciences, but they have not yet
received the attention they deserve from philosophers of science. This
conference attempts to systematically explore methodological issues in
connection with computer simulations and the implications of these for
traditional questions in the philosophy of science. Special emphasis is put on
the relation between models and simulations as well as on the role of computers
in the practice of science.
</p>
<p>
The papers presented at the conference will address, among others, the following
questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>What difference does the essentially dynamic nature of simulations make to
modeling, particularly in their representational abilities?</li>
<li>Is there a difference between simulations that have an explicit model or
theory behind them and those that do not?</li>
<li>When there is no model, what form does the representational connection
between the simulation and the world take?</li>
<li>Can any sense be made of claims that the world itself is carrying out
computations and simulating itself?</li>
<li>What role does intentionality play in simulations or such apparently
automatic representational processes as genetic algorithms?</li>
<li>Are there principles that one can use to decide whether a simulation is to be
interpreted realistically or only instrumentally?</li>
<li>At what level (e.g. the machine code, the algorithmic, the scientific
language) does a simulation represent a system?</li>
<li>It is well-known hat models enter into different relationships such as
isomorphism, embedding, or being a submodel of. Are there analogous relations
between simulations?</li>
<li>What would qualify as an equivalence relation between simulations?</li>
<li>What is the relation between simulations used as an experimental tool and
real experiments?</li>
<li>How does the methodology of simulations compare with experimentation?</li>
<li>How, if at all, do models and simulations explain?</li>
<li>What are the implications of the growing use of simulations in science for
our understanding of science?</li>
<li>What are the implications of the repeated use of the same models and
simulations within different fields of science?</li>
<li>How reliable are the results of simulations, and how is the reliability of a
simulation determined?</li>
<li>What role does mathematics play in simulations?</li>
<li>Is there a difference between the use of simulations across different fields
such as physics, biology, and the social sciences?</li>
<li>Is there a difference between the use of simulations in fundamental science
and in applied science?</li>
</ol>
<p>

6. CALL FOR PAPERS: Ashgate Companion to Contemporary Philosophy of Biology.
</p>

Deadline: May 15, 2006.
</p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Call for Papers. We have been asked by Ashgate Publishing to edit their Ashgate
Companion to Contemporary Philosophy of Biology. Our approach to this project
will emphasize the importance of information-theoretic considerations as well as
more familiar philosophical and scientific ones. Our rationale for this approach
is that, although central to the biological sciences, the idea of information
has received little attention from philosophers of biology. To address this
omission, we seek papers on topics that employ this approach to advance
understanding of topic-related philosophical problems and controversies.
Although we have included a broad list of possible topics (see below), we are
willing to consider others provided that they also reflect the collection¹s
overall approach. Interested authors should include an abstract of the paper
they propose for the collection (not to exceed 500 words), together with a copy
of their cv. Abstracts should be submitted by May 15, 2006, and authors whose
contributions are accepted will be informed by June 15, 2006. The deadline for
accepted papers is February 1, 2007. Submit relevant materials to:
terzisgn@slu.edu; arpr@southwestmsu.edu.
</p>
<p>
Objectives of the Companion. Information pervades biological processes at all
levels of organization. Familiar examples of these processes include how
organisms utilize free energy, how DNA codes for protein synthesis, how genes
regulate morphological development, and even how ensembles of nerve cells
coordinate their activity in a way that enables some organisms to be
aware of their environment. But although pervasive, the contribution that
information-related ideas make to our understanding of these processes is not
yet well understood. Indeed, only recently have researchers begun to explore
their deeper theoretical significance. Of course, an understanding of these
processes also depends on a variety of more traditional biological and
non-biological scientific considerations. But the combining of these
considerations with information-related ones will almost certainly add greater
accuracy and depth to our grasp of such processes.
</p>
<p>
A similar point may be made about our understanding of the traditional
philosophical issues and controversies associated with the previously noted
biological processes. For example, since organisms use information to construct,
maintain, and replicate themselves, it would also seem natural to include
information-related ideas in our attempt to understand the general nature of
living systems, the causality by means of which they operate, their capacity to
generate prolific bio-diversity, whether or not they could exist and evolve in
non-biological matter, and how in some species they give rise to cognition and
emotion. But, again, philosophers of biology have only begun to include
information-related ideas in the repertoire of methodological considerations
they use to discuss these philosophical issues.
</p>
<p>
Our approach to this volume thus seeks to correct what we believe is a
long-standing neglect of those informational considerations relevant to an
understanding of both the scientific and philosophical significance of a variety
of basic biological processes. To be sure, the inclusion of these considerations
can only add to the controversies that already existed in their absence. For
example, how closely or remotely related to one another are the informational
ideas that are employed at different levels of biological organization? Second,
although the presence of informational ideas at these levels is undeniable,
their philosophical significance is another matter. Is that significance a
literal one, or is it more metaphorical and heuristic? Finally, in order to
defend a specific philosophical interpretation of these ideas, we require a more
general information-theoretic perspective. But is there one such perspective, or
are there different, competing ones? Although difficult questions, we feel that
any aversion toward answering them is overridden by the fact, now nearly
undeniable, that information is integral to our understanding of biological
phenomena. For this reason, these questions are as much in need of further
philosophical examination as are the more familiar ones.
</p>
<p>
Audience. The collection of papers represents a broad range of disciplines,
including anthropology, biology, chemistry, computer science, information
theory, paleontology, philosophy, physics, psychology, and systems theory. The
papers will be written to meet the needs of advanced undergraduate and graduate
students enrolled in philosophy of science, philosophy of biology, and
theoretical biology courses. The papers are also intended to enable interested
researchers to learn about the contribution that information makes to both the
biological sciences and philosophy of biology.
</p>
<p>
Organization of the Text. Section 1, which introduces readers to the nature and
methodology of philosophy of biology, incorporates not only traditional
scientific and philosophical considerations, but also information-theoretic
ones. Sections 2-7 then discuss a variety of increasingly complex biological
topics to which this methodology can be applied. For example, Section 2 begins
with the general idea of organisms as hierarchically organized systems that use
information to construct, maintain, and replicate themselves, while Sections 3
and 4 expand this idea to take into account the
evolutionary character of organisms in both natural and artificial environments.
Next, Sections 5 and 6 show that this idea can also be applied to psychological
concepts in humans and higher primates. Finally, a conclusion summarizes the
broader philosophical significance of the information-enhanced approach to the
biological topics presented in this text.

7. HPSM LISTSERV: Covering the History and Philosophy of Science in the
Northeast of
 England.
</p>
<p>
The History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine (HPSM) Network was founded by
Durham University's Department of Philosophy in 1999. The purpose of the HPSM
listserv is to create a network for researchers with links to the north of
England who are interested in topics broadly relevant to the history and
philosophy of science and medicine (including bioarchaeology and palaeopathology).
This is accomplished by posting messages that advertise HPSM events (lecture
series, departmental seminars, individual papers, conferences, museum displays,
etc.), research (new lectureships, research projects, funding proposals, etc.)
and collections (material, archival, cyber, etc.). At present, the list has over
one hundred academic subscribers, as well students reading for an MA or PhD in
HPSM related subjects. The list includes staff members from the Centre for Life
(Newcastle) and the universities of Durham, Newcastle, Sunderland, Teesside,
York, Leeds, Manchester, Lancaster, Leicester and Warwick. However, there are
several independent scholars too. The listserv is moderated, but it is open to
anyone with a genuine interest in HPSM studies. To join, simply send an email to
Dr Matthew D Eddy (M.D.Eddy@durham.ac.uk).

</ul>
<p>
Sightseeing and social events include tours of the museums and galleries
(Archeology museum, Museum of old Croatian monuments, etc.) in Split, visits to
the old Roman center as well as boat excursion on the Adriatic.
</p>
<p>
Facilities: Symposium sessions will be held in the Student Center - Spinut - of
the University of Split. On the same place are also dormitories. Photographs of
this place are attached to this Invitation. Lecturing hall contains auditorium
with seating capacity ranging from 100 to 150. All the conventional audiovisual
equipment including computer projection is available. There is also coffee bar
and restaurant for refreshments.
</p>
<p>
Housing will be arranged in the University dormitories at Spinut campus (street
Sinjska 6) and at local hotels, which are within walking distance of campus.
Campus prices for single room is 150 Kn per person, double room 1s 130 Kn per
person (Note that 1 USD = 6 Kn, or 1EURO = 7.35 Kn). Inexpensive meals are
available in on-campus dining facilities. There is also a broad range of
restaurants within walking distance because Campus is very close to the center
of Split.
</p>
<p>
Location and Transportation: After Zagreb, Split is the largest city in Croatia.
It is located in the most attractive region of Croatia, in central Dalmatia on
the Adriatic coast. Transportation to Split is simple because there is
international airport. There are also many fast inter-city train connections
with Zagreb, and people coming by car can use the highway A-1, E-71 (nearly 400
km from Zagreb). Croatia Airlines flights daily on the line Zagreb - Split.
Another possibility is to use Dubrovnik international airport, which is 200
kilometers away from Split.

<p>
Publication of Symposium Papers: Several recent symposia have resulted in
published volumes. Every effort will be made to provide an appropriate venue for
publication of the papers presented at this symposium. A special issue of
Foundations of Chemistry is an excellent option, but others may appear as the
time approaches.
</p>
<p>
Registration: The completed registration form (vancik@irb.hr) and abstract (one
typewritten page) should be received by the organizer (Prof. H. Vancik) until
June 1, 2006. An abstract should be sent either in the form of MS Word Document
