      Deadline:  15 November 2007. http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/faculties/humanities/tilps/RSS2008/

KEYNOTE SPEAKERS: William Bechtel (UCSD), Craig Callender (UCSD), Paul Griffiths
(Sydney), Kevin Hoover (Duke), Philip Pettit (Princeton)
</p>
<p>
ORGANISERS: Mark Colyvan (Sydney), Stephan Hartmann (Tilburg), Maurice Schouten
(Tilburg) and Katie Steele (Sydney)
</p>
<p>
Science presents us with a variety of accounts of the world. While some of these
accounts posit a deeper theoretical structure and fundamental entities, others
do not. But which of these accounts is the right one? How should science
conceptualize the world? And what is the relation between the various accounts?
Opinions on these issues diverge wildly in philosophy of science. At one extreme
are reductionists who argue that higher-level theories should, in principle, be
incorporated in or eliminated by the basic level theory. Higher-level theories
do not ultimately exhibit conceptual integrity or provide genuine explanations.
At the other extreme are pluralists who take higher levels of description and
explanation seriously and argue for their independence and indispensability. Our
goal in this conference is to bring together representatives from as many
viewpoints as possible in order to advance our understanding of this problem. We
invite case studies from the natural, social and behavioural sciences as well as
discussions of philosophical models of intertheoretic relations.
</p>
<p>
We invite submissions of papers of up to 3000 words by 15 November 2007.
Decisions will be made by 15 January 2008.
</p>
<p>
GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS: A few travel bursaries for graduate students are
available; if you wish to be considered please submit a short (tentative) travel
budget and a CV together with your paper by 15 November 2007. Decisions will be
made by 15 January 2008.
</p>
<p>
BEST GRADUATE PAPER AWARD: We offer an award of 500 Euro for the best submitted
paper by a graduate student. The winner will be announced on 15 January 2008.
</p>
<p>
PUBLICATION: Revised versions of selected papers will be published in a special
issue of Erkenntnis. The deadline for submission of the final version of the
paper is 1 June 2008.
</p>
<p>
The conference language is English.

4. Winners of the Lakatos Award in Philosophy of Science 2006:  Harvey Brown and
Hasok Chang.
</p>
<p>
Harvey Brown (Professor of Philosophy of Physics, University of Oxford) for his
book Physical Relativity: Space-time Structure from a Dynamical Perspective
(Oxford University Press 2005)
</p>
<p>
Brown’s book develops a critical account of the way that Einstein formulated his
special theory of relativity, concentrating on a tension between its kinematical
and dynamical aspects. It sheds new light on central issues such as the alleged
conventionality of simultaneity and the relationships between the special and
the general theory of relativity.
</p>
<p>
Hasok Chang ( Reader in Philosophy of Science, University College London) for
his book Inventing Temperature: Measurement and Scientific Progress (Oxford
University Press 2004)
</p>
<p>
Chang’s book attacks the seemingly simple question ‘What is temperature and how
can we measure it?’ He shows, however, that pursuing that question leads to new
perspectives on a range of general issues about scientific reasoning and the
authority of science.

9. Call for Abstracts:  Biological Explanations of Behavior: Philosophical Perspectives.
    Deadline:  December 1st, 2007.
</p>
<p>
Thursday, June 12th to Sunday, June 15th, 2008, Leibniz University of Hannover,
Germany.
</p>
<p>
This conference will be organized around three general themes: explanations in
behavioral genetics, developmental explanations of behavior, and the evolution
of behavior. Possible topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
evolutionary explanations of human and animal behavior (e.g., altruism), causal
claims in behavioral genetics, behavioral traits as natural kinds, logical
analyses of arguments in evolutionary psychology, and comparisons of the
different ways that biologists from different disciplines explain behavior. In
addition, we welcome papers that include philosophical analyses of concepts
central to biological explanations of behavior, such as innateness, imprinting,
and particular behavioral traits.
</p>
<p>
The conference will begin with a keynote address that is intended to set the
agenda for the conference. On each of the three following days, there will be
a plenary lecture in the morning in accordance with the theme for the day, which
will then be followed by topical sessions of contributed papers. The conference
sessions will be organized in series (rather than in parallel sessions) so that
participants will have the opportunity to attend all presentations. While this
means we will accept fewer papers, we believe that this will lead to a more
coherent conference with more intensive participation from all attendees.
</p>
<p>
Program:
</p>
<p>
Thursday, June 12: Registration &amp; evening keynote address.<br />
Keynote lecture by Helen Longino
</p>
<p>
Friday, June 13: Day theme: explanations in behavioral genetics<br />

</p>
<p>
This conference is organized by Kathryn Plaisance and Thomas Reydon, and is
jointly sponsored by the Center for Philosophy and Ethics of Science (ZEWW) at
the Leibniz University of Hannover and the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of
Science (MCPS) at the University of Minnesota.
</p>
<p>
Publication of a small selection of papers delivered at the conference is
planned to appear as an edited volume of the Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy
of Science, to be edited by Kathryn Plaisance, Thomas Reydon, and C. Kenneth
Waters. The volume will include papers by the keynote speaker and each of the
plenary speakers. In addition, there will be room for four to six contributed
papers, based on quality and fit. The deadline for paper submissions will be
several weeks after the conference, and decisions about publication will be made
promptly.
</p>
<p>
Please submit an abstract of up to 500 words to beb@ww.uni-hannover.de. We
prefer that you attach a Word document that includes your contact information
(Name, Department, Institution, Email) followed by your abstract. The deadline
