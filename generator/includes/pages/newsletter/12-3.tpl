6. CALL for Papers: Science Studies &amp; Science
Education. Deadline: March 31, 2007.
</p>
<p>
Special Issue / New Section
</p>
<p>
Science Education has a long tradition of publishing articles about the
relationships between history and philosophy of science and science education.
Science Education published the first scholarly papers on sociology of science
and science education. Recently, it has provided a vibrant forum for research on
argumentation and scientific discourse, drawing from such fields as
rhetoric,epistemology, and cognitive sciences. As educational research moves to
more nuanced understandings of science teaching and learning, we believe we can
both learn from science studies as well as provide evidence relevant to the
"blind spot" of science studies -- education. In 2007 Science Education will
publish a special issue and institute a new section of the journal focusing on
"Science Studies&amp; Science Education."
</p>
<p>
The intents of this special issue are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>To clarify/illuminate/analyze/discuss the potential significance of science
studies for science education;</li>

<li>To provide a forum for the scholarly exchange of ideas and theories regarding
science education and science studies;</li>

<li>To launch a new "Science Studies &amp; Science Education" section for Science
Education. "Science Studies" is a group of
disciplines that draw from history, philosophy, anthropology and sociology of
science as well as cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. The primary
focus of Science Studies is to understand science as an epistemic and socio-
historical endeavor. The study of science classrooms as
environments characterized by epistemic, cognitive, social and affective
factors should benefit from Science Studies scholarship. Science Studies holds
the potential to contribute to the policy and practice level implementation in
science education. Hence, for the special issue and the subsequent establishment
of the new section on science studies we will solicit manuscripts that develop
our understanding of howScience Studies applies to theory, methodology, policy
and practice of science education.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Some example applications of Science Studies in science education might include
the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Epistemic Questions: How are ideas formulated, evaluated and developed in
science? In science teaching and learning?</li>

<li>Cognitive Questions: What constitute scientists' ways of reasoning? What
can we learn from cognitive analyses of scientists to help school children and
university students in learning science?</li>

<li>Historical Questions: How do scientific and classroom ideas change over
time? What factors contribute to change?</li>

<li>Anthropological Questions: How are classroom and research group cultures
produced? Maintained? Changed?</li>

<li>Sociological Questions: What historical, political and social norms
characterize and guide the scientific enterprise? How do such norms translate to
classroom science learning environments?</li>

<li>AI Questions: What logical and other formal reasoning capabilities and
patterns underlie domain specific inquiry in science and scientific thinking?
Are there general patterns of reasoning that are
valuable across all scientific domains?</li>

<li>Political Questions: How do we implement the theoretically best
educational practices into the very constrained real world of science education?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Manuscripts for this Special Issue should be submitted online. Information
regarding the preparation of manuscripts and directions for online submission is
available at:
<a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jhome/32122" rel="external">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jhome/32122</a>

<p>
For online submissions, submit files at:
<a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/scied" rel="external">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/scied</a>
</p>
<p>
Please indicate in a cover letter to the editor that you would like
the manuscript to be considered for publication in the ScienceStudies
and Science Education Special Issue.
</p>
<p>
A Rationale for Science Studies and Science Education
</p>
<p>
The label "science studies" is relatively new and has many meanings so we think
it is beneficial for us to share our working understanding. Examples of Science
Studies' disciplines include history of science, sociology of science,
anthropological studies of science, philosophy of science and
cognitive/psychological/AI studies of scientific reasoning. The oldest of the
science study discipline sis philosophy of science dating back to antiquity.
History of science was established in the academy at the beginning of the 20th
century with sociology of science not far behind. Cognitive science and
AI emerged at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century
with anthropology of science being the most nascent of the group. Like
science itself, the initial forays were mainly pursued
individually without the benefits of journals, conferences, associations
or specialized educational programs.
</p>
<p>
The twentieth century saw the institutionalization of the science studies
subjects with some attempts to join them in Centers andPrograms for the History
and Philosophy of Science. Prior to 1960,history of science was divided into
two types -- internal and external histories. Internal histories of science were
concerned with the concepts and logic of theories; external histories were
concerned with the broader institutional, cultural and technological influences,
such as the differences in the acceptance of Newtonian theory in England and
France or the role of science societies in the advancement of science. Prior to
1960 the philosophy of science with its emphasis on logic and language was
almost exclusively internal.
</p>
<p>
Under the influence of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions
and similar research such as that by Norwood Hanson, Michael Polanyi,Stephen
Toulmin, Robert Merton, Ludwig Fleck, and Ernst Nagel, among others, the
assumption that internal and external accounts could be pursued independently
was rejected. Kuhn's work encouraged other disciplines to take science itself as
a subject and psychology,anthropology, and economics of science all were born.
The "internal" study of science assumed that the development of science could be
studied as a purely logical enterprise without consideration of such factors as
the nature of the human mind, the availability of social networks, of social
norms, of competitive and cooperative motivations, of social rewards and risks,
of information networks or of the financial support for the process. In the
last several decades these factors have been studied and while most research
tends to focus on one or two dimensions, fruitful interactions are increasingly
common.
</p>
<p>
Just as internal history and philosophy of science had a narrow focus on the
logic of scientific processes, research shows that science education has had and
continues to have a similar narrow focus on logical and conceptual elements.
Science studies now recognize that scientists do not just collect data, they
design experiments to collect the data and they refine and interpret both the
data and experiments. In each case what they could do and what they actually do
are influenced by their motivations, by the social, informational and
technological resources available, and by the available alternative theories and
models. Scientists also write about, read and argue about data, models, theories
and explanations and in each case there are social and cultural contexts that
influence their interpretations or their choice of statements.
</p>
<p>
Students also learn and do science within contexts that include aloof these
factors. Ignoring these factors does not make them irrelevant, it only means
that science education has been blind totem. Our goal is to broaden the range
of issues, interpretative frameworks, and methodological orientations relevant
to the production of knowledge in educational settings. Establishing a
new section of the journal will create a forum for the exchange of scholarly
ideas and research results on "Science Studies &amp; Science Education."
</p>
<p>
Given the current focus on domain-specific inquiry in science education, it
becomes imperative to achieve a fuller comprehension of the nature of reasoning
in various disciplines and sub disciplines. Further, there is a need for deeper
understanding of the epistemic,material, linguistic, and communicative, and
representational practices in these areas. Another important area of
needed scholarship is the rich science/society interactions
continually occurring and how these ongoing practices are situated in
broader social, intellectual, political, and economic contexts. Work with
and within these domains could contribute significantly to understanding science
thus informing educators as they help students and the public to understand and
critique scientific knowledge and knowledge about science.
</p>
<p>
Another viable area of research concerns the place of activities related to
science education in Western society and how this view compares and contrasts
with science in other cultural and technological contexts. This focus would
include manuscripts addressing the present-day politics of science and science
education,and the publics' engagement in matters of science education
and policy making. Decisions here are important because they depend on whether
we are considering education related to the reproduction of disciplinary
practices (technical mastery) or education aimed at more general, citizen
level of understanding. And then there is also the need to consider at what
level (e.g., elementary to postgraduate) and in which contexts (e.g., formal/in
school to informal/ out of school) such decisions are appropriate or not. While
some science education researchers explore such issues, the extent to
which these scholars use or reference the knowledge bases of science studies is
an open question. The special issue and the new section aim to expand scholarly
discourse by including traditional and contemporary perspectives that frame our
understandings about sciences a way of knowing.
We hope that the special issue and the new section will create forum
where cross-disciplinary boundaries are challenged and where considerations of
science and science classrooms as cultural and epistemic endeavors will
stimulate re conceptualizations of the traditionally distinct fields of
anthropology and epistemology.
