     1.
ANNOUNCEMENT from PSA Secretary George Gale:  Michael Dickson appointed next
            Editor-in-Chief of Philosophy of Science.


</p>
<p>
The PSA Editor Search Committee
received five applications for the editorship of the journal. After a thorough  review of the applications, and several weeks of
spirited discussion among the committee members, Prof. Michael Dickson, of the University of South Carolina, was chosen as the leading
candidate. His name was forwarded to the Governing Board of the Association,
which approved his selection.
</p>
<p>
The choice was a difficult one: the field was an extremely strong one,
certainly the strongest that
I can remember.  In the end, it came down to a judgment call by the
committee.
</p>
<p>
The Committee and the officers thank the candidates very much for their
applications: without the kind of generosity that their applying demonstrates,
the Association simply couldn't remain the kind of high quality organization
that it is.
</p>
<p>
Changes in paper submission procedures will be announced as they are worked out
during the transition between editors.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Philip Kitcher, Chair</li>
<li>Jeffrey Bub</li>
<li>Noretta Koertge</li>
<li>Margaret Morrison</li>
<li>George Gale</li>
</ul>

     2.  ANNOUNCEMENT
from PSA Secretary George Gale:  PSA
election results.
</p>
<p>


Here are the results of
this round of elections:

</p>
<p>

Governing Board:  Christopher Hitchcock, Kenneth Schaffner, C. K.
Waters, Alison Wylie
Nominating Committee:  Jeff
Barrett, Paul Griffiths, Peter Lipton.
</p>
<p>
All terms run from 1 Jan 04 until 31 Dec 05. Hitchcock and Wylie are
second-time winners (will they never learn? :), and hence are ineligible to run
for a third term until the election of '06.
</p>
<p>
Elliott Sober will select the chair of the Nom. Comm.
</p>
<p>
My thanks to everyone--both officers and candidates-- who participated in this
election. It's no easy thing to go out and find people willing to serve; nor is
it any easier for those willing few to face the challenge of a race; and
finally, it isn't easy for the 'winners' (!) to do the actual service. Our
Association benefits mightily from all your contributions.

     3. University of Pittsburgh Acquires Papers of
Philosopher Richard C. Jeffrey.

</p>
<p>
The University of Pittsburgh Library
  System has acquired the personal and professional  papers of the late Richard C. Jeffrey, professor of philosophy
emeritus at Princeton University, who passed away on
November 9th of 2002.
</p>
<p>
     Jeffrey was born in 1926 in Boston, Mass. He earned his M.A. in Philosophy
at the University of Chicago in 1952 and his Ph.D.
at Princeton University in 1957. He is
considered to be one of the most influential philosophers of decision-making in
the 20th century.
</p>
<p>
     Jeffrey's philosophical career is
intimately intertwined with the story of 20th century philosophy. Most of his
teachers had participated in the development of Logical Positivism in Vienna and Berlin in the twenties and
early thirties. He worked with Rudolf Carnap at Chicago, with Kurt
GÃ¶del at the Institute for Advanced Study, and with Carl Gustav Hempel at Princeton. His work is unified by
his development of Bayesianism, the view that making up one's mind is a matter
of adopting judgmental probabilities. Besides being the most influential
philosopher working in
decision theory, he was also a major proponent of developing and securing the
heritage of logical empiricism, himself championing radical probabilism,
a view that denies objective probability and abandons attempts to analyze
judgment into a rational and an empirical component.
</p>
<p>
     Among his many publications are
works such as  The Logic of Decision, McGraw Hill, 1965, a collection of
essays entitled Probability and the Art of Judgment, Cambridge, 1992, and also
two textbooks entitled Formal Logic: Its Scope and Limits, McGraw Hill, (first published
in 1967) and Computability and Logic, with G. Boolos (first published in 1974).
</p>
<p>
      His papers will now join those of
his teachers Rudolf Carnap and Carl Gustav Hempel and other important
representatives of philosophy of science at the Archives of Scientific
Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh Library
  System.
  </p>
<p>
      The papers were generously donated
to the University by his wife Edith Jeffrey. We thank her for this gift to the
research community and for her valuable support and advice throughout this
process.

     4.  University of Pittsburgh Acquires Papers of Philosopher Wesley
C. Salmon.


</p>
<p>
The University
 of Pittsburgh Library System has
acquired the professional and scholarly papers of the late Wesley C. Salmon
(1925-2001), University Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Professor of
History and Philosophy of Science at the University
 of Pittsburgh, who died in April of
2001 in a car accident.
</p>
<p>
      Wesley Salmon,
a prominent and internationally renowned philosopher of science, earned his
doctorate at the University of California,
Los Angeles, in 1950, under Hans
Reichenbach, one of the leading figures of 20th century philosophy
of science.
</p>
<p>
      After teaching
at several universities, Salmon was appointed Norwood Russell Hanson Professor
at Indiana University
in 1963. He moved to the University
 of Arizona in 1973 and joined the
faculty at the University of Pittsburgh
in 1981 as professor and chairman of philosophy, professor of history and
philosophy of science, as well as resident fellow in the Center for Philosophy
of Science. From 1983 until his retirement in 1999, he held the rank of
University Professor of Philosophy, succeeding Carl G. Hempel in this post.
</p>
<p>
      Salmon's work
included research on the problems of space and time, the character of
reasoning, probability and confirmation, and the problem of causality and
scientific explanation. His achievements  were recognized by two Festschrift
books in his honor. His own influential writings include "The Foundations of
Scientific Inference" (1967), "Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure
of the World" (1984), "Four Decades of Scientific Explanation" (1990), and
"Causality and Explanation" (1998).
</p>
<p>
      Salmon's work has built upon and enriched a
distinguished scientific philosophical movement prominently represented by,
among others, his teacher Hans Reichenbach, his colleague and intellectual
inspiration Carl Gustav Hempel, and Rudolf Carnap, all of whose papers are
already part of the Archives of Scientific Philosophy at the University
 of Pittsburgh Library System.
</p>
<p>
      The papers
were generously donated to the University by his wife Merrilee
Salmon, herself a Professor Emerita of the history
and philosophy of science, philosophy, and of anthropology at the University
 of Pittsburgh. We are grateful to
her for this valuable gift to the research community.
