2. Philosophy of Science Syllabus Sampler
-----------------------------------------
Call for Syllabi:

PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
SYLLABUS SAMPLER

This assemblage of selected syllabi in philosophy of science will serve as a
guide for novice teachers and a reference for more experienced teachers (much
like the History of Science Society's 1992 publication).  Syllabi will be
selected for their clarity and completeness and to convey a diverse
cross-section of perspectives and pedagogical strategies.  An introductory
essay will distill the most frequent topics and texts.

The sampler hopes to incorporate several thematic foci:
        General Survey I:  Metaphysics & Core Concepts
        General Survey II:  Science Studies Orientation
        Race, Gender and Science
        Philosophy of Biology
        Philosophy of Physics
        Philosophy of Psychology & the Social Sciences
        Special Topics

A complete syllabus must contain the following information:
        1. description of the course's primary objectives and/or its
		framework and main themes
        2. topic outline and weekly schedule
        3. complete reading list (with full citations)
        4. instructor's name, institution, address, and phone or e-mail
Any additional commentary on the context or design of the course is welcome.

Please send syllabi for consideration to:
        Douglas Allchin
        Dept. of Biology
        University of Texas at El Paso
        El Paso  TX  79968

9. Conference on Unscientific Psychology
----------------------------------------
Unscientific Psychology: Conversations With Other Voices
A two day conference on progress and possibilities in creating a cultural,
relational and performatory approach to understanding human life

June 14-15, 1997
Edith Macy Conference Center
Briarcliff Manor, New York

Sponsored by the Center for Developmental Learning of the East Side Institute
for Short Term Psychotherapy

With each passing day, psychology's inability to provide solutions to
critical questions history has raised as we approach the 21st century becomes
more apparent.  Just about everyone -- theoreticians, practitioners, policy
makers, consumers and the general public - - is growing more and more
disillusioned with psychology, as it fails to understand or deal successfully
with pressing issues such as the nature of human sociality and anti-
socialness, emotional pain, violence, identity, sexuality, prejudice and
bigotry, creativity, depression, learning and educational failure, memories
false and true, to name just a few.

>From the postmodern vantage point, the current crisis in psychology and the
related fields of psychotherapy and education is rooted in misguided efforts
to emulate the natural sciences: Human-social phenomena simply cannot be
understood with the tools and conceptions that are used to study nature.

Subjecting psychology to postmodern deconstruction, contemporary
psychologists and philosophers find it to be a complex interweaving of the
modern science paradigm with centuries-old philosophical presuppositions.
 Psychology's core conceptions -- such as development, behavior, the
individual, the self, stages and patterns, rationality and irrationality,
normality and abnormality -- are themselves rooted in philosophical-
scientific assumptions about what it means to understand and to know.  The
challenge to psychology is equally a challenge to the modernist conception of
understanding and knowing and its commitment to deeply-rooted
methodological-philosophical biases, such as truth, objectivity, causality,
duality and linearity.  Understanding human life, some leading postmodern
voices argue, demands a new epistemology.

Creating a new epistemology -- an unscientific psychology -- is the activity of
making new meaning.  It is an emergent conversation created by and out of
diverse voices who speak more poetically, culturally and historically than
analytically and taxonomically.  It is a conversation about persons (not
minds), about relationships and relationality (not environmental influences
on self-contained individuals), about human activity (not behavior), about
narratives and stories (not Truth), about creating new forms of life (not
adapting to forms of alienation).  What is emerging is an approach to
understanding human life as emergent, activisitic, relational and
performatory.

The invited presenters are leading voices in this conversation.  The
combination of rigor and creativity in their scholarship and practice is a
provocative challenge to orthodox psychology.

10. New Ph.D. Programme in Philosophy and Economics
-----------------------------------------------
Erasmus University is launching a new Ph.D. Programme in Philosophy
and Economics in 1997. Thanks to recent appointments, Erasmus
University has created a unique centre devoted to the combined study
of philosophy and economics. The Ph.D. programme exploits the
expertise of specialists such as Uskali Maki, Arjo Klamer, Maarten
Janssen, Jack Vromen, and Albert Jolink at the Erasmus Institute of
Philosophy and Economics.

The Ph.D. Programme consists of one year advanced course work and two
years of research within the broad framework of the Erasmus Institute
Research Programme 'Institutions'. The advanced courses will go into
topical issues in the philosophy of economics, microeconomics and game
theory, evolutionary and new institutional economics, history of
economic thought, and the rhetoric and culture  of economics. The
Research Programme is organized under four headings: 'Economics of
Institutions', 'Institutions of Economics', 'Economics in Philosophy'
and 'Philosophy in Economics' (a detailed description of the research
programme is available upon request).

The Ph.D programme is open to all candidates who have a completed
Master's degree in economics, in philosophy, or  in the philosophy of
economics, and who have a strong interest in subjects falling within
any or all of the themes of the Research Programme. (Those who are
within 3 months of completion of their Master's may also apply.) The
tuition for the first year is Dfl. 10.000. After the first year,
students can apply for a fellowship of approximately Dfl. 24.000 per
year for the second and third year.

The deadline for applications is 15 February 1997. Subject to the
availability of positions, applications received before 31 July 1997
may be considered. The Programme will start in September 1997.
