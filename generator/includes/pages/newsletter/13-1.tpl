     First Biennial Conference, August 23-25, 2007.  University of Twente,
Enschede,
     The Netherlands, <a href="http://www.gw.utwente.nl/spsp/" rel="external">http://www.gw.utwente.nl/spsp/</a>   Deadline: March 1,

Deadline for submission: 1 March 2007.
</p>
<p>
The Society for Philosophy of Science in Practice (SPSP) aims to bring
together a community of scholars that approach topics in the philosophy of
science from the perspective of scientific practice.  For further details on
our objectives, see our mission statement at <a href="http://www.gw.utwente.nl/spsp/" rel="external">http://www.gw.utwente.nl/spsp/</a>
</p>
<p>
The first SPSP biennial conference is intended as a broad agenda-setting
forum for scholars who are committed to making detailed and systematic
studies of scientific practice without dismissing concerns about truth and
rationality, or ignoring contextual and pragmatic factors.  We welcome
contributions from not only philosophers, but also historians and
sociologists of science, pure and applied scientists, and any others with an
interest in philosophical questions regarding scientific practice.
</p>
<p>
In addition to keynote lectures by invited speakers, the conference will
feature parallel sessions in which contributed papers will be presented. In
this first biennial conference, we are aiming for a broad and diverse
programme that will demonstrate the range of already existing work;
subsequent conferences may be organised around more focused themes.
</p>
<p>
We particularly welcome contributions on the following list of
interconnected topics; however, other topics are by no means excluded.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem-solving and scientific research</li>
<li>The role of models in scientific practice</li>
<li>Instruments in relation to theory and experiment</li>
<li>Computer experiments and simulations</li>
<li>Explanation and understanding in scientific practice</li>
<li>Epistemology, ethics, and theory of action</li>
<li>Values in science, technology and medicine</li>
<li>Methodology in various sciences: similarities and differences</li>
<li>Historical development of scientific practices</li>
</ul>

Philosophy of Science and the IHPST, Paris.
</p>
<p>
The conference language is English.
</p>
<p>
Computer simulations play an important role in many scientific contexts, and
they are often based on a particular model of the phenomenon under
investigation. This raises questions both about the nature and methodology
of simulations themselves, as well as their relations to models. These
issues have recently attracted some attention, and were also discussed at
the 'Models and Simulations' conference in Paris in June 2006. The aim of
the present conference is both to provide a forum to continue ongoing
debates and to try to slightly shift the focus of attention. So far case
studies played an important role in the debates over models and simulations
and a lot has been learned from them. We are now also interested in
theoretical approaches that attempt to rationalize these cases and help
furthering our philosophical understanding of how models and simulations
explain, how they are confirmed, how they relate to theories and other
models, and how they represent.
</p>
<p>
Please submit extended abstracts of 1000 words through our abstract
submission system (see website) by 15 April 2007; decisions will be made by
15 May.

belief, and uncertainty,
bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic
reasoning, epistemic logic, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning
about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, and foundations of
multi-agent systems.

ENDNOTES:
</p>
<p>
A. The purpose of this newsletter
</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information. The
newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to
members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings or other information likely to be of
interest to a broad range of membership).
</p>
<p>
B. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONS
</p>
<p>
Send information for possible inclusion in a future issue of the newsletter
to the editor (<a href="mailto:mforster@wisc.edu" rel="email">mforster@wisc.edu</a>). It is best to send the information
directly to the editor 4 months in advance of any deadline because
publication dates are usually unpredictable. Please include PSA somewhere in
the subject line (so that the message is automatically filed).
</p>
