2. PSA 1998:  Call for Symposia Proposals
</p>
<p>
Members of the PSA are invited to submit proposals for symposia to be
presented at the 1998 PSA meeting in Kansas City, October 21-25.
Proposals must include sufficient supporting material to permit the
program committee to evaluate the quality and interest of the symposium.
The proposal should include: (1) the title of the proposed symposium; (2)
a description of the topic and a justification of its current importance
to the discipline (about one to two pages); (3) titles and abstracts of
papers; (4) a list of participants and either an abbreviated cv or a short
biographical information file for each; (5) addresses of each participant,
with the institutional affiliation, postal and email addresses, and
telephone and fax numbers.  Please indicate clearly the name of the
organizer or contact person for the purposes of communication with the
Program Committee.
</p>
<p>
A selection of symposium papers will be published after the meeting in PSA
1998, vol. 2, which will be published as a supplementary issue of
Philosophy of Science.  Organizers should make it clear to symposium
participants that, normally, by accepting the invitation to participate
in a symposium them agree to present a paper at the meeting and to deliver
a manuscript for consideration for publication shortly after the meeting.
Symposium organizers who wish to invite someone who would not submit a
manuscript for publication should make that status clear in the symposium
proposal.
</p>
<p>
Symposium proposals should reach the Program Committee Chair, Don Howard,
no later than 31 July 1997. Send to:  Don Howard, Chair, PSA 1998 Program
Committee, History and Philosophy of Science, 346 O'Shaughnessy,

6. Sciece and Technology Studies at  NSF
</p>
<p>
Two new NSF competitions are just announced or in the works, and a
brief reminder:
</p>
<p>
1.  IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training) these
are large (5 years x $500,000) awards for groups of scholars to combine
graduate education with research in an interdisciplinary area. The
program announcement is now available on the NSF web page (www.nsf.gov)
and questions should be directed to JOHN PERHONIS (<a href="mailto:jperhoni@nsf.gov" rel="email">jperhoni@nsf.gov</a>).
</p>
<p>
2.  The next Science and Technology Centers competition is in the works.
These are very large in scope, and very unlikely to suit our field, but
may be opportunities for us to collaborate with other fields on campus.
Questions to <a href="mailto:fferreir@nsf.gov" rel="email">fferreir@nsf.gov</a>.
</p>
<p>
3.  And, in case you've forgotten, AUGUST 1 is the next target date for
research grants, postdoctoral fellowships, Small Grants for Training and
Research, and dissertation improvement awards from the Science and
Technology Studies program.
</p>
<p>
In FY 1997 the program spent $3,000,000 on 40 or so research grants and
about 20 dissertations.
</p>
<p>
Consult our web page (www.nsf.gov/sbe/sber/sts/start.htm) or contact Ed
Hackett (<a href="mailto:ehackett@nsf.gov" rel="email">ehackett@nsf.gov</a>) with questions.
