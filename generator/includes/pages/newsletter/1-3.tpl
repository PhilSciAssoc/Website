Subject: 1. EDITOR'S NOTE:
</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The
newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to
members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings of the Association, and information
about other meetings likely to be of interest to a broad range of the
membership.  It is NOT intended for ungoing discussions of intellectual
topics within philosophy of science.  If you have information that you
would like to submit for possible inclusion in a future issue of the
newsletter, please send it to the editor at psa@twinearth.wustl.edu.

Subject 2. Next PSA Meeting and Call for Papers
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
				  PSA96
</p>
<p>
The Fifteenth Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association
will be held November 1-3, 1996, at the Stouffer Renaissance Cleveland
Hotel at Tower City Center in Cleveland, Ohio.

                           CALL FOR PAPERS

                 PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE ASSOCIATION

                     FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL MEETING

</pre>
<p>
Contributed papers may be on any topic in the philosophy of science.
Maximum length is 5000 words, counting footnotes and references.  If the
text includes tables or figures, an appropriate number of words should be
subtracted from the limit.  Two copies, each including a 100 word abstract
and a word count should be submitted in double-spaced typescript.  Format
and citation style should match those of Philosophy of Science.  (See a
recent issue for details.) If the paper is too long or the references
incomplete, the paper will be returned to the author.  Papers will be
blind refereed; therefore, the author's name, institutional affiliation,
surface and email addresses, and fax and telephone numbers should appear
on a separate page. Hard copy of submissions must reach the chair of the
program committee by November 15, 1995.  Accepted papers will be published
prior to the meeting in a supplemental issue of the journal Philosophy of
Science.  Notification about the status of submissions will be mailed in
late January or early February.  A finished manuscript (one hard copy and
one on floppy disk, the latter in IBM or Macintosh format, using a
standard word processor) must be submitted by March 1, 1996.  Authors of
accepted papers are expected to present abbreviated versions of their
papers, with a time limit of 20 minutes (plus discussion).

3. Matchette Lectures in Philosophy, Science, and Mathematics
</p>
<p>
The Philosophy Department, Purdue University, is pleased to announce the
1996 Matchette Lectures in Philosophy, Science, and Mathematics.  James
Robert Brown (University of Toronto) will deliver three public lectures,
"Pictures and Proofs," at Purdue on February 20, 21, and 22.  These
lectures are made possible by a grant from the Franklin J. Matchette
Foundation.  For further information, phone 317-494-4275 or send email to
curd@sage.cc.purdue.edu.

	 Special Journal Issue on Scientific Discovery

Advisory Editors: Bruce Buchanan (Pittsburgh), Lindley Darden

Submissions:  Nov 1, 1995
Appearance:   Scheduled for early 1996
</pre>
<p>
In recent years, a substantial number of programs have been built and
studied that perform nonroutine tasks in scientific discovery.  Work
on machine discovery is aimed at exploring and enlarging the scope of
computing within science (scientific inference).  Many of us believe
that the potential for computers in this domain is very extensive, but
there are also rational skeptics.  An excellent way to resolve this
issue is to produce programs that perform scientific work competently,
and to characterize these programs in terms of general architectural
features.  A recent AAAI Spring Symposium on scientific discovery
included both types of contributions.
</p>
<p>
We seek submissions that address these fundamental issues, especially
descriptions of working programs that achieve some form of creativity.
Such programs may, for example, analyze data to discover descriptive
or explanatory laws, conduct laboratory procedures automatically, plan
experiments and experimental strategies, design instruments and
research procedures, discover or revise appropriate problem
representations, search for relevant data, draw inferences and make
predictions from existing theories. That is, they participate in the
numerous activities that are involved in scientific discovery.
(Programs that perform in areas where computers are already main
players are only relevant for this special issue, if they display the
sort of creativity listed above.)
</p>
<p>
Other appropriate submissions, not based on the description of a new
program, might draw on the accumulated experience already reported in
the literature to make more general statements about the scope of
computing in science, about how best to extend its scope, or how to
enhance existing programs. Such submissions, while more theoretical,
should be based on the properties of working programs, should be
rooted in empirical evidence, and should bear on scientific practice.
</p>
<p>
All submissions should discuss the basic AI techniques which they have
used in the course of building their Discovery System.  Given the
maturity of the Scientific Discovery field, we would not expect to
publish, in this special issue, papers whose basic approach is
regression analysis or simple curve fitting.
</p>
<p>
Where all this may lead was foreseen by Allen Newell [quoted by D.G.
Bobrow and P.J. Hayes in "Artificial Intelligence - Where Are We?"
Artif.Intell.; 25(3), 1985]:
</p>
<p>
 We should, by the way, be prepared for some radical, and perhaps
 surprising, transformations of the disciplinary structure of science
 (technology included) as information processing pervades it. In
 particular, as we become more aware of the detailed information
 processes that go on in doing science, the sciences will find
 themselves increasingly taking a metaposition, in which doing
 science (observing, experimenting, theorizing, testing, archiving, ...)
 will involve understanding these information processes, and
 building systems that do the object-level science. Then the
 boundaries between the enterprise of science as a whole (the
 acquisition and organization of the knowledge of the world) and AI
 (the understanding of how knowledge is acquired and organized)
 will become increasingly fuzzy.
</p>
<p>
If you intend to make a submission, please send a brief description
well before the deadline to Raul Valdes-Perez (Computer Science
Department; Carnegie Mellon University; Pittsburgh, PA 15213; USA).
Email to valdes@cs.cmu.edu is preferred.
