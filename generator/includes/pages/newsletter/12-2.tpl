1. CALL for Applicants, PSA Executive Secretary
</p>
<p>
The Philosophy of Science Association seeks applications for the post of
Executive Secretary, service to begin in June 2008. Qualified applicants
are requested to send c.v. to PSA-ESSEARCH@listserv.umkc.edu.
The PSA reserves the right to hold the search open
until a satisfactory candidate has been found.
Successful candidates will be energetic, knowledgeable in the field,
and possess some management and/or business experience.
</p>
<p>
The Philosophy of Science Association is an international organization which
promotes research, teaching, and free discussion of issues in the
philosophy of science from diverse standpoints. To
this end, the PSA engages in activities such as: the
publishing of periodicals, essays and monographs;
sponsoring conventions and meetings; and awarding prizes for distinguished
work in the field. There are approximately 2000 members in PSA,
distributed among 30-some countries. PSA is a
non-profit U.S. corporation, directed by a Governing
Board that has eight elected Board members, the President,
President-elect, and the Past-president
</p>
<p>
The Executive Secretary is the chief managing/executive officer of the PSA;
included among the duties of the Executive Secretary are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Executing the decisions of the Governing Board;</li>

<li>Managing the fiscal and financial affairs of the Association;</li>

<li>Directing annual elections;</li>

<li>Coordinating the activities involved in producing the biennial meetings;</li>

<li>Overseeing the PSA-side of actions of the joint PSA-HSS Business Office.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Executive Secretary terms run for four years, although the Executive Secretary
serves at the pleasure of the board.
The office of Executive Secretary is unpaid, although it may be possible to
negotiate funding for a course release.

2. IN MEMORIAM: Ellery Eells (1953 - 2006).
Dearly missed by those who knew him well.
</p>
<p>
Ellery Eells gained major recognition from his book,
Rational Decision and Causality (Cambridge University Press) in 1982, after
graduating with a PhD in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley,
in 1980. The book was published at the height of the
uproar about Newcomb-style counterexamples to Bayesian decision
theory. In it, he developed the novel position that Bayesian decision
theory can produce the same answers as the new causal decision theory if
deliberation is viewed as a dynamical process. Besides spear-heading this new line of
research in decision theory, his work rekindled interest in old questions about
the relationship between causality and probability. In 1991, he published
a major work on Probabilistic Causality, which won the
American Philosophical Association's Franklin J. Matchette Prize in 1995.
In the meantime he was publishing papers in a third area, confirmation
theory. His best known paper in this area is &quot;Problems of Old
Evidence&quot;, which was originally published in the Pacific
Philosophical Quarterly in 1985. It has been reprinted twice since then.
</p>
<p>
After holding a one year visiting position at North Carolina State University,
Ellery moved to the University of
Wisconsin-Madison in 1981, where he received tenure in 1985, and was promoted to
full Professor in 1990. He never left Madison.
</p>
<p>
This year he was a returning member of the Governing Board of the PSA. He has
always been tireless in his service to the philosophy of science community,
especially behind the scenes. For example, he normally wrote more than ten reviews and referee
reports per year.
</p>
<p>
To those who knew him personally, Ellery was a kind and gentle person with a
quiet, but cheerful, demeanor. Academically, had an unparalleled patience for details, which
shows up very clearly in his published work. (He once told me that he had
never had a paper rejected for publication!) His patience made him popular
amongst the graduate students and colleagues who sought his expertise,
and equally amongst those who were novices in his field. Ellery was the
person with whom you'd want to share committee work as well; he was hard-working
and reliable, and would always have copious notes. When serving on the
admissions committee, for instance, Ellery was always able to summarize the best
points of every candidate. He was always looking for the good in people.
</p>
<p>
Ellery fell into a coma during the night of August 4, 2006, after being
hospitalized the day before, and died five days later. He is survived by
his wife, Joanne Tillinghast, son Justin and daughter
Erica. Anyone interested in sending a sympathy card can write to
Joanne Tillinghast, 13 Backbay Circle,
Madison, WI 53717. There will be a memorial
session for Ellery Eells at the Pacific APA meetings, San Francisco, April 2007.

Williamson (University of Kent), and John Worrall (LSE)
</p>
<p>
What distinguishes science from all other human endeavours is that the accounts
of the world that our best, mature sciences deliver are strongly supported by
evidence and this evidence gives us the strongest reason to believe them. While
this is the distinctive mark of science, unanimity has still to emerge among
philosophers of science about the logic of confirmation and induction used to
relate evidence to science. The state of these logics stands in stark contrast
to that of deductive logic, where there is essentially no dispute over which are
the good systems of deductive logic. Opinions on confirmation and induction
diverge wildly in philosophy of science. At one extreme are those such as the
Bayesians or learning theorists, who believe that the true system of inductive
logic has been found and all that needs to be resolved are the details. At the
other are skeptics, such as some supporters of the underdetermination thesis,
who hold that no logic can vindicate the level of support scientists claim for
their best, mature theories, for, they urge, the real inductive import of
evidence cannot be that decisive. Between these extreme are many intermediate
positions, including the view that the very nature of inductive inference
remains poorly understood.
</p>
<p>
Our goal in this conference is to bring together representatives from as many of
these viewpoints as possible in order to advance our understanding of this
problem. The conference will encourage contributions from philosophers of
science with both systematic and critical perspectives as well as papers that
develop revealing case studies in science.
</p>
<p>
The conference is generously supported by the Centre for Philosophy of Science,
University of Pittsburgh, LSE's Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social
Science (CPNSS), the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, and the Mind
Association.

5. CALL for Abstracts: Second Perspectives on
Mathematical Practices conference, March 26 - 28,
2007,
 Vrije Universiteit,
Brussels, Belgium.
<a href="http://www.vub.ac.be/CLWF/PMP2007." rel="external">http://www.vub.ac.be/CLWF/PMP2007.</a>
Deadline: Nov. 15, 2006.
</p>
<p>
The general philosophical theme of this meeting will be that of why and how
philosophers and historians of mathematics need each other. This takes for
granted the thesis, ventilated by Lakatos, that they do so. One is here
referring, of course, to his famous paraphrase of Kantian dictum: &quot;The history
of mathematics, lacking the guidance of philosophy, has become blind, while the
philosophy of mathematics, turning its back on the most intriguing phenomena in
the history of mathematics, has become empty&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Any serious attempt of remedying this, and thus approaching the history and
philosophy of mathematics, will either &quot;bring to&quot; philosophy the historian's
expertise of conducting meticulous diachronical case-studies, or else &quot;bring to&quot;
history the philosopher's concern with epistemological depth; preferably both.
Moreover, a focus on the historical dimension of mathematical practices is not
to the exclusion of contemporary themes. To the contrary: Lakatos's point
pertains to the historicity or growth of mathematical knowledge, past and
present.
</p>
<p>
Invited speakers: David Corfield (Tübingen, Germany) - José Ferreirós (Seville,
Spain) - Jens Høyrup (Roskilde, Denmark) - Brendan Larvor (Hertfordshire, UK) -
Paolo Mancosu (Berkeley CA, US) - Gianluigi Oliveri (Palermo, Italy) - Yehuda
Rav (Paris, France).
