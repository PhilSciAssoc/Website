1.    PSA 2006: Call for Symposium Proposals and Workshop Proposals.  Deadline: Dec. 1, 2005.

</p>
<p>

Philosophy of Science Association

</p>
<p>

Nineteenth Biennial Meeting:
November 2-5, 2006
</p>
<p>
Vancouver, British Columbia

</p>
<p>

Members of the Philosophy of
Science Association (PSA) are invited to
submit proposals for symposia and
workshops to be presented at the PSA
2006 meeting in Vancouver,
British Columbia, November 2-5.  Proposals
must include sufficient
supporting material to permit the program
committee to evaluate the quality
and interest of the symposium or
workshop.

</p>
<p>

Symposia will follow the
traditional format, whereby the papers
presented will be submitted for
consideration for publication in a
supplementary issue of Philosophy
of Science.  The evaluation for
publication will be on entire sessions,
that is, all papers in the
session will be published
together.  All contributions for symposia will
be electronically archived,
whether or not they are accepted for
publication.

</p>
<p>

Workshops follow the same format
as used for PSA 2004.  There is no
expectation that the papers
presented will be submitted for review for
publication.  This format
may be more attractive to sessions involving
participants from outside the
philosophical community, and/or for
exploratory-stage research.
Authors may choose to have their papers
archived in electronic
form.  Some workshops may take the form of lunch
roundtables or mentoring
sessions.

</p>
<p>

Proposals for both symposia and
workshops should include:

</p>
<ol>
<li>
The title of the proposed symposium or workshop
</li>
<li>
A description of the topic and a justification of its current

importance to the discipline (about one or two pages)
</li>
<li>
A short descriptive summary of the proposal (100-200 words)
</li>
<li>
Titles and abstracts of all papers
</li>
<li>
A list of participants and either an abbreviated curriculum vitae or


short biographical description for each
</li>
<li>
Institutional affiliation and e-mail addresses for all participants
</li>
<li>
Full contact information for the organizer (who may or may not be a


proposed speaker), to be used for communication with the Program Committee
</li>
</ol>
<p>

The PSA 2006 Program Committee
will strive for quality, variety,
innovation and diversity on the
program.  We encourage proposals in both
traditional and novel areas of
philosophy of science.

</p>
<p>

The deadline for Symposium and
Workshop proposals is December 1, 2005.
Decisions about acceptance will
be made by mid-February, 2005.

</p>
<p>

Proposals must be electronically
submitted at
http://philsci.org/PSA06/submit

</p>
<p>

All questions about submissions
should be directed to:

2.   ANNOUNCEMENT for Memberships in
the School of Historical Studies, Princeton Institute
       for Advanced Study.   Deadline: 15 November 2005.
</p>
<p>

INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY
</p>
<p>
Princeton, New Jersey

</p>
<p>

ANNOUNCEMENT OF MEMBERSHIPS
IN THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES
for the academic year 2006-2007


</p>
<p>


THE
INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY was founded in 1930 as a community of scholars in
which intellectual inquiry can be carried out in the most favorable
circumstances.  It provides Members
with libraries, offices, seminar and lecture rooms, subsidized restaurant and
housing facilities and some secretarial and word-processing services.

</p>
<p>

THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES supports scholarship in all
fields of historical research, but is concerned principally with the history of
western, near eastern and far eastern civilizations, with particular emphasis
upon Greek and Roman civilization, the history of Europe (medieval, early
modern, and modern), the Islamic world, East Asian studies, the history of art,
and modern international relations.
The School also offers the Edward T. Cone Membership in Music Studies.
Qualified candidates of any nationality are invited to apply for
memberships.  Residence in
Princeton during term time is required.
The only other obligation of Members is to pursue their own
research.  If they wish, Members
may participate in seminars and meetings both within the Institute and at
nearby universities, and there are ample opportunities for contacts with other
scholars.

</p>
<p>

Approximately
forty Members are appointed for either one or two terms each year.  The Ph.D. (or equivalent) and substantial
publications are required of all candidates at the time of application.  Member awards are funded by the
Institute for Advanced Study or by other sources, including the National
Endowment for the Humanities and the Thyssen Foundation.

</p>
<p>

APPLICATION
may be made for one or two terms (September to December, January to
April).  Further information and
application materials may be found on the School's web site, www.hs.ias.edu, or they can be obtained from the
Administrative Officer by electronic mail at
mzelazny@ias.edu, or inquiries can be
sent by post to: School of
Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced Study, Einstein Drive, Princeton,
New Jersey 08540.  Completed
applications must be returned to the Administrative Officer by 15 November
2005.

</p>
<p>

OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES

</p>
<p>

MELLON
FELLOWSHIPS FOR ASSISTANT PROFESSORS are also offered each year to two
qualified Assistant Professors.
These full-year memberships are designed specifically for assistant
professors at universities and colleges in the United States and Canada to
support promising young scholars who have embarked on professional
careers.  Applicants must have
served at least two, and not more than four years as assistant professors in
institutions of higher learning in the United States or Canada and must have
approval to return to their institution following the period of
membership.  Stipends will match
the combined salary and benefits at the Member's home institution at the time
of application, and all the privileges of membership at the Institute for
Advanced Study will apply.
Application materials are the same as for membership, and can be
obtained from the web at www.hs.ias.edu, or by contacting the Administrative
Officer at the address above.

</p>
<p>

ACLS/FREDERICK
BURKHARDT FELLOWSHIPS FOR RECENTLY TENURED SCHOLARS:
</p>
<p>
In the academic year 2006-2007
the Institute for Advanced Study anticipates it will again take part in a
program sponsored by the American Council of Learned Societies, the Frederick
Burkhardt Fellowships. These fellowships support more adventurous, more
wide-ranging, and longer-term patterns of research than are current in the
humanities and related social sciences. Depending on the availability of funds,
ACLS will provide fellowships for up to eleven recently tenured faculty, most
of whom will spend a year at one of several residential research centers,
including the Institute for Advanced Study. A scholar applying for the academic
year 2006-2007 must normally have begun her/his tenured contract at a U.S.
institution no earlier than the fall 2001 semester or quarter. Applicants must
submit a research plan, typically covering a three to five year period; one of
the first three years of research could be spent as a Member at the Institute,
either in the School of Historical Studies or the School of Social Science.

</p>
<p>

Qualified
candidates who would like to apply under the auspices of this program should
visit the ACLS website, http://www.acls.org/burkguid.htm,
for a more detailed description of the terms of the fellowship and information
about how to apply. Applications for this program must be submitted through the
ACLS Online Fellowship Application system (OFA) no later than 9 p.m., Eastern
Daylight Time, September 28, 2005.
OFA is accessible at http://ofa.acls.org
or through the ACLS website.
Information about this program may also be obtained from the ACLS
Fellowships Office, 633 Third Avenue, 8th floor, New York, NY 10017-6795.

</p>
<p>
Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia
June 2-5, 2006
</p>
<p>
We learn from
our mistakes. But are we learning
enough?  Contributions to this conference, whether
philosophical, historical, statistical, and/or methodological will all in some
way reflect an aspect of &quot;learning from error,&quot; conceiving
&quot;error&quot; very broadly, (e.g., mistakes of inference, flawed methods,
statistical errors, misspecified models, anomalous results, erroneous verdicts,
deceptions in nature, biases and fallacies). What kinds of errors seem to
matter most in improving method, advancing reliability, avoiding threats
(natural and man-made). How do/can we make progress in building a
&quot;repertoire of errors&quot; and techniques to circumvent, or capitalize
upon them?
</p>
<p>
Special Invited Speakers (thus far):
Peter Achinstein (Johns Hopkins), Alan Chalmers (Adelaide), Sir David Cox
(Oxford), Clark Glymour (Carnegie Mellon),  Henry Kyburg (Rochester),
Larry Laudan (UNAM), Alan Musgrave (Otago), John Worrall (LSE).

<p>
The International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science (HOPOS) is
an international society of scholars with special interest in research on the
history of philosophy of science and related topics in the history of natural
and social sciences, logic, philosophy, and mathematics. This shared interest
includes all historical periods, geographical regions, and diverse
methodologies. The activities promote historical work in a variety of ways,
including the sponsorship of meetings and conference sessions, the publication
of books and special issues of journals, maintaining an e-mail discussion
group, and the dissemination of information about libraries, archives and
collections, and bibliographic information. For further information, please go
to http://www.umkc.edu/scistud/hopos.
</p>
<p>
The Société de philosophie des sciences (SPS) was founded in Paris in 2003,
following broad consultations among French-speaking philosophers of science and
logicians. Its purpose is to promote philosophy of science. While its
geographic and linguistic anchoring is French, it aims at an international
constituency, hoping to attract colleagues from everywhere. The focal
discipline is philosophy of science, with a privileged connection to other
areas in philosophy, but historical and other approaches of science are taken
in, and the contribution of the sciences themselves is deemed
essential. Finally, although academic research constitutes the core of its
activities, the Society hopes to attract professionals from other areas, such
as secondary school teachers, journalists and other media specialists, science
museum personnel, industrial researchers and engineers, and workers in the
medical and legal professions. For further information, please go to http://www.sps.ens.fr.

5.   CONFERENCE:  "Scientific Images" Mini-conference in
conjunction with the APA Pacific

       Division
Meeting, March 21-26, 2006, Portland Hilton, Portland, Oregon.

</p>
<p>

Images are a prominent
feature of contemporary science, but philosophers are still at an early stage
in understanding their epistemic contributions to scientific practice.
This mini-conference aims to advance understanding of scientific images by
pulling together approaches from several relevant disciplines, such as the study
of non-linguistic models by philosophers of science, the debate over the nature
of depiction or pictorial representation by philosophers of art, and work on
perception and perceptual knowledge in philosophy of mind and epistemology.
</p>
<p>
Volunteers to serve as chairs or commentators-at-large are welcome.
For information contact Dominic McIver Lopes &lt;dom.lopes@ubc.ca&gt;.

9.  SPECIAL Journal Issue:  "Mechanisms in Biology".

</p>
<p>

Studies
in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences announces the June 2005 special issue dedicated
to "Mechanisms in Biology,&quot; with guest editors Carl F. Craver and Lindley
Darden.

</p>
<p>

Philosophers
of biology increasingly recognize that explanations in many areas of biology
describe mechanisms. Yet there are disputes about what mechanisms are, how
mechanistic explanations differ from other explanations, which areas of biology
use or require mechanistic explanations, and how the current enthusiasm in
biology for mechanisms relates to historical forms of mechanism in biology and
elsewhere. This issue combines historical and philosophical perspectives on
these and related questions. Some earlier versions of the papers were presented
at the Second Reichenbach Conference, "Fashioning a Mechanistic Philosophy of
Science," held at Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, 7-9 November,
2003. Other papers were solicited to round out the focus on specifically
biological mechanisms.

</p>
<p>

Topics
include comparison of historical and contemporary ideas about mechanisms (Carl
Craver and Lindley Darden); seventeenth century views of mechanisms (Dennis Des
Chene); nineteenth and early twentieth century views of mechanism (Garland
Allen); Darwin's non-use of the term &quot;mechanism&quot; in the Origin but his use in describing contrivances in
orchids (Michael Ruse); mechanisms of speciation and the possible adaptedness
of isolating mechanisms (Jason Baker); analysis of natural selection as a
mechanism (Rob Skipper and Roberta Millstein); interfield relations, not
reduction, between mechanisms in classical genetics and molecular biology
(Lindley Darden); multifield, multilevel descriptions of mechanisms, not
reduction, in neuroscience (Carl Craver); critique of the regularity view of
causation in favor of the productivity view  and an assessment of the roles of generalizations in
neuroscience (Jim Bogen); a critique of nomological  explanations and the advantages of mechanistic explanations
(William Bechtel and Adele Abrahamsen); the nature of mechanical models and
their testing (Stuart Glennan).

 ENDNOTES:

 A. The purpose of this newsletter

</p>
<p>

The PSA Newsletter is
published electronically on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis  by the Philosophy of Science
Association to disseminate information.
The newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent
to members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings or other information likely to be of
interest to a broad range of membership).

</p>
<p>


 B. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONS

</p>
<p>

Send information for
possible inclusion in a future issue of the newsletter to the editor
(mforster@wisc.edu).  It is best to
send the information directly to the editor as early as possible because
publication dates are unpredictable.
Please include PSA somewhere in the subject line (so that the message is
automatically filed).

</p>
<p>

UNSUBSCRIBING
