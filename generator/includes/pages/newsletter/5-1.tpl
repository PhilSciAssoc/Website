<p>
3. ELECTION RESULTS
</p>
<p>
The PSA Election results are now official:
</p>
<p>
John Earman is President-elect, Allan Franklin and Paul Humphreys were
re-elected to the Governing Board, and Robert Brandon and Margaret Morrison are
newly-elected members of the Board.

</p>
<p>
Below are calls for SYMPOSIA PROPOSALS and CONTRIBUTED PAPERS:
</p>
<p>
CALL FOR SYMPOSIA PROPOSALS
</p>
<p>
Members of the PSA are invited to submit proposals for symposia to be presented
at the PSA 2000.  Proposals must include sufficient supporting material to
permit the program committee to evaluate the quality and interest of the
symposium.  The proposal should include:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The title of the proposed symposium</li>
	<li>A description of the topic and a justification of its current importance to
	the discipline (about one or two pages)</li>
	<li>Titles and abstracts of papers</li>
	<li>A list of participants and either an abbreviated curriculum vitae or a short
	biographical information file for each</li>
	<li>Addresses of each participant, with the institutional affiliation, postal and
	email addresses, and telephone numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>
Please indicate clearly the name of the organizer or contact person for the
purposes of communication with the Program Committee.
</p>
<p>
In addition to inviting proposals in traditional areas of the philosophy of
science, the Program Committee wants also to encourage the submission of
proposals in areas where the philosophy of science engages social issues in
science or issues in science policy.
</p>
<p>
A selection of symposium papers will be published after the meeting as a
supplementary issue of Philosophy of Science.  Organizers should make it clear
to symposium participants that, normally, by accepting the invitation to
participate in a symposium they agree to present a paper at the meeting and to
deliver a final manuscript of the paper by 15 January 2001.  Symposium
organizers who wish to invite someone who would not submit a manuscript for
publication should make that status clear in the symposium proposal.
</p>
<p>
Symposium proposals should reach the chair of the Program Committee no later
than 1 November 1999.
</p>
<p>
All submissions should be directed to:
</p>

<p>
SUBMITTED PAPERS
</p>
<p>
Members of the PSA are invited to submit papers to be presented at the PSA 2000
meeting in Vancouver, B.C. on 4-7 November 2000.  Contributed papers may be on
any topic in the philosophy of science, but in addition to inviting papers in
traditional areas of the philosophy of science, the Program Committee wants also
to encourage the submission of proposals in areas where the philosophy of
science engages social issues in science or issues in science policy.  The
deadline for submissions is 1 March 2000.  Some papers will be accepted for both
presentation at the PSA 2000 meeting and publication in a supplementary issue of
Philosophy of Science, other papers will be accepted just for presentation.
In each case, the Program Committee expects to make its decisions by 1 June
2000.  Final versions of all papers accepted for publication must be submitted
by 15 January 2001.
</p>
<p>
Continuing with the tradition established for the sixteenth-biennial meeting,
contributed papers accepted for presentation at the meeting will not be
published before the meeting.  Papers whose authors so wish will be made
available prior to the meeting on the PSA 2000 web site
(<a href="http://scistud.umkc.edu/psa2k" rel="external">http://scistud.umkc.edu/psa2k</a>).  In order for a paper to be put on the web site
before the meeting, it must be submitted in Portable Document Format (pdf),
Postscript (ps), or plain text (ASCII).  Abstracts of all papers accepted for
presentation will be published on the web site and in an expanded meeting
program.
</p>
<p>
The maximum recommended manuscript length is 5,000 words, including footnotes
and references.  If the text includes tables or figures, an appropriate number
of words should be subtracted from the limit.  Submissions must include a
100-word abstract and a word count.  Format and citation style should match
those of the journal, Philosophy of Science (see a recent issue for details).
Since papers will be blind refereed, the author's name, institutional
affiliation, surface and email addresses, and telephone number(s) should appear
only on a separate cover letter or cover sheet.  Submissions will be accepted in
one of the two following forms:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Send a copy of the abstract to <a href="mailto:psa2k@uci" rel="email">psa2k@uci</a>. edu.  Send three (3) copies of the
	paper, formatted as above,
	to:
	<ul class="address">
	<li>Jeff Barrett, Chair</li>
	<li>PSA 2000 Program Committee</li>
	<li>Logic and Philosophy of Science</li>
	<li>University of California, Irvine</li>
	<li>Irvine, California 92697-4130</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Send one copy of the paper, formatted as above, in either Portable Document
	Format (pdf), Postscript (ps), or plain text (ASCII) to <a href="mailto:psa2k@uci" rel="email">psa2k@uci</a>. edu as an
	email attachment.  In the body of the email include your name, institutional
	affiliation, address, telephone number, and a copy of the abstract.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Authors of accepted papers are expected to present abbreviated versions of their
papers, with a time limit of approximately twenty minutes (plus discussion).

5. McDonnell Centennial Awards goes to Kathleen Akins
</p>
<p>
Kathleen Akins, a philosopher of science at Simon Fraser University, is
one of 10 recipients of the $1,000,000 James S. McDonnell Centennial
Fellowships. Her project is entitled More than Mere Colouring: A Dialogue
Between Philosophy and Neuroscience on the Nature of Spectral Vision. The
official announcement of her award lauded her research on questions that
have been central to human inquiry for millennia and are poised to be
reconceived as a result of our increasing ability to understand the
workings of animal and human brains. The citation cited her previous work,
which demonstrates that she is able to bring neuroscientific findings to
bear on important philosophical problems in an original and
thought-provoking way and that she should have a serious impact on
everyday and scientific thinking about human minds and human behavior by
clearing away outdated presuppositions and models and offering us new ways
of conceiving ourselves. Dr. Akins will use part of the award to involve a
group of very promising younger philosophers.
</p>

<p>
6. Deborah Mayo wins Lakatos Prize
</p>
<p>
Deborah Mayo, a Virginia Tech philosophy professor, recently was awarded
the world's premiere academic prize for the study of the philosophy of
science. She is the co-recipient of the 1998 Lakatos Prize for her
provocative 1996 book, "Error and the Growth of Experimental Knowledge."
</p>
<p>
Mayo, 45, is the first woman chosen for the honor, named 25 years ago
for a London School of Economics philosopher, Imre Lakatos. She will
earn a half share of 10,000 British pounds (about $8,250) and the chance
to give an honorary lecture at the London School in March.
</p>
<p>
Mayo's book, in the works for the better part of two decades, is no
beach blanket page turner, but it has been hailed as an important new
contribution to philosophy. It describes a new theory of how scientists
can determine the truth of hypotheses through experiment.
</p>

<p>
7. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION SOCIETAL DIMENSIONS PROGRAM
</p>
<p>
The next target date for proposals to the Societal Dimensions of
Engineering, Science, and Technology (SDEST) program is August 1, 1999.  The
Societal Dimensions program includes Ethics and Values Studies (EVS) and
Research on Science and Technology (RST).  It focuses on improving knowledge
of ethical and value dimensions in science, engineering, and technology, and
on improving approaches and information for decision making about investment
in science, engineering, and technology.  The newly revised announcement
(NSF99-82) can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov:80/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf9982;" rel="external">http://www.nsf.gov:80/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf9982;</a>
more program information is available at
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov:80/sbe/sber/sdest/start.htm." rel="external">http://www.nsf.gov:80/sbe/sber/sdest/start.htm.</a>
</p>
<p>
SDEST considers proposals that examine the full range of questions that
arise in the interactions of science, technology and society.  To discuss
research ideas, contact program manager Rachelle Hollander at
<a href="mailto:rholland@nsf.gov" rel="email">rholland@nsf.gov</a>. The program is particularly interested in encouraging
analysis of ethical questions surrounding new developments in biotechnology
and information technology.  It is also interested in proposals that
identify and evaluate the implications of different strategies for support
of scientific and engineering research and innovation on quality of life.
</p>
<p>
Biotechnologies and information technologies are transforming social and
physical landscapes.  The SDEST program is interested in considering
research proposals to identify and examine the ethical and value dimensions
that are part of these developments.  Questions in need of analysis range
from issues of informed consent (to purchase of products from genetically
modified organisms or to on-line research observation, for instance) to
issues of social and environmental change (e.g., from the
socio-environmental patterns of food production and distribution to the
interactions of communication and information technologies with educational
systems).
</p>
<p>
These technologies and their embedding in social/environmental systems
illustrate social returns from scientific and technological innovation:  how
the social institutions in which innovations are developed and managed
influence their structures, processes, outputs, outcomes, and impacts.  The
SDEST program is interested in supporting research projects to develop and
test methods and models by which these economic, environmental, and social
returns can be identified, quantified, or analysed.  Such studies can
illuminate questions concerning how to set priorities for public support for
science and technology.
</p>
<p>
Support is available through regular grants for research and education
projects such as:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Scholars Awards enable individuals to undertake full time research
during part or all of an academic year or summer. Awards can include
postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student research assistance. Up to
$18,000 in summer support and $60,000 for semester support is allowed; the
maximum award is $120,000, expected to extend over 24 months</li>
<li>Grants for collaborative research, infrastructure or education projects.
Often, investigators require only part time support to undertake research; a
multi-disciplinary research team may be needed. Such projects may also
require research assistants, travel, supplies, etc. Infrastructure projects
may involve a variety of activities to stimulate new research areas,
outreach efforts, and development and dissemination of appropriate data
bases, text retrieval systems, and graphic resources for research,
educational or public use. Ethics education projects can be directed to
pre-college, undergraduate or graduate studies. Education proposals should
indicate how their efforts will have impacts beyond improvements at a single
institution.  EVS also considers proposals for conference support, when a
national organization or professional society is sponsoring the meeting.</li>
<li>Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants provide funds for
research expenses not normally available through the student's university.
The dissertation advisor is the principal investigator on these
applications; the doctoral student is listed as co-principal investigator.
No indirect costs are allowed, and the usual limit on an award is $8,000 for
research in North America and $12,000 for work abroad.</li>
<li>Post-Doctoral and Professional Development Fellowships, undertaken with
the direction of one or more host specialists, provide cross-disciplinary
training opportunities for scientists or engineers, or humanities scholars,
allowing them to improve their research in EVS areas.  Awards provide a
stipend from $35,000 to $60,000, and $4,000 each for travel and the host
institution allowance.</li>
<li>Small Grants for Training and Research are awards to senior investigators
that provide sustained research opportunities for graduate students and
post-doctoral fellows on SDEST issues.  These proposals should identify a
specific theme and organize training around it.  Support for up to three
graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow for each of three years is
allowed; the maximum award is $100,000 yearly.</li>
<li>Foundation-wide Programs:  SDEST also participates in such NSF programs
as CAREER and POWRE.  For further information on these programs, see
Cross-Cutting Programs on the NSF home page:
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/start.htm." rel="external">http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/start.htm.</a></li>

10. MEMBERSHIPS IN THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES
</p>
<p>
THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY was founded in 1930 as a community of
scholars in which intellectual inquiry can be carried out in the most
favorable circumstances.  It provides Members with libraries, offices,
seminar and lecture rooms, subsidized restaurant and housing facilities and
some secretarial and word-processing services.
</p>
<p>
THE SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL STUDIES supports scholarship in all fields of
historical research, but is concerned principally with the history of
western and near eastern civilization, with particular emphasis upon Greek
and Roman civilization, the history of Europe, Islamic culture, the history
of modern international relations, and the history of art.  In addition to
these fields, in the academic year 2000-2001 the School will support three
Members in the comparative history and culture of traditional China, Japan,
Korea, and Vietnam.  Qualified candidates of any nationality are invited to
apply for memberships.  Apart from residence in Princeton during term time,
the only obligation of Members is to pursue their own research.  If they
wish, however, Members may participate in seminars and meetings both within
the Institute and at nearby universities, and there are ample opportunities
for contacts with other scholars.
</p>
<p>
Approximately forty Members are appointed for either one or two terms each
year.  The Ph.D. (or equivalent) and substantial publications are required
of all candidates at the time of application.  Member awards are funded by
the Institute for Advanced Study or by other sources, including among others
the National Endowment for the Humanities whose support will enable three
U.S. citizens to take up full-year memberships, and the Thyssen Foundation
which will support two German citizens.
</p>
<p>
APPLICATION may be made for one or two terms (September to December, January
to April).  Further information and application materials may be obtained
from the Administrative Officer, School of Historical Studies, Institute for
Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 (electronic mail address:
<a href="mailto:mzelazny@ias.edu" rel="email">mzelazny@ias.edu</a>).   Completed applications must be returned to the
Administrative Officer by 15 November 1999.
</p>
<p>
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES
</p>
<p>
MELLON FELLOWSHIPS FOR ASSISTANT PROFESSORS are also offered each year to
two qualified Assistant Professors.  These full year memberships are
designed specifically for assistant professors at universities and colleges
in the United States and Canada to support promising young scholars who have
embarked on professional careers.  Applicants must have served at least two,
and not more than four years as assistant professors in institutions of
higher learning in the United States or Canada, and must have approval to
return to their institution following the period of membership.  Stipends
will match the combined salary and benefits at the Member's home
institution, and all the privileges of membership at the Institute for
Advanced Study will apply.  Qualified applicants may apply for one type of
membership only.  No dual applications will be accepted.  For additional
information and application forms contact the Administrative Officer at the
address above.
