<h1>PSA Newsletter: Vol. 1 No. 1: May 1995</h1>
<p>
Enclosed is the first issue of the newly reborn PSA Newsletter.  This
newsletter is being created to provide timely distribution of information
relevant to members of the Philosophy of Science Association.  This issue,
for example, contains the call for papers for the next biennial meeting.
The newsletter is moderated, and I will restrict what appears in the
newsletter to maintain as high a content-to-noise ratio as possible.

The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The

information about upcoming meetings of the Association, and information
about other meetings likely to be of interest to a broad range of the
membership.  It is NOT intended for ongoing discussions of intellectual
topics within philosophy of science.  If you have information that you
would like to submit for possible inclusion in a future issue of the
newsletter, please send it to the editor at psa@twinearth.wustl.edu.

2. CALL FOR PAPERS for 1996 PSA MEETING
</p>
<pre>
			   CALL FOR PAPERS

		 PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE ASSOCIATION

		     FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL MEETING

</pre>
<p>
The Fifteenth Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association
will be held in the Fall of 1996 at a date and location to be announced.
Contributed papers may be on any topic in the philosophy of science.
Maximum length is 5000 words, counting footnotes and references.  If the
text includes tables or figures, an appropriate number of words should be
subtracted from the limit.  Two copies, each including a 100 word abstract
and a word count should be submitted in double-spaced typescript.  Format
and citation style should match those of Philosophy of Science.  (See a
recent issue for details.) If the paper is too long or the references
incomplete, the paper will be returned to the author.  Papers will be
blind refereed; therefore, the author's name, institutional affiliation,
surface and email addresses, and fax and telephone numbers should appear
on a separate page. Hard copy of submissions must reach the chair of the
program committee by November 15, 1995.  Accepted papers will be published
prior to the meeting in a supplemental issue of the journal Philosophy of
Science.  Notification about the status of submissions will be mailed in
late January or early February.  A finished manuscript (one hard copy and
one on floppy disk, the latter in IBM or Macintosh format, using a
standard word processor) must be submitted by March 1, 1996.  Authors of
accepted papers are expected to present abbreviated versions of their
papers, with a time limit of 20 minutes (plus discussion).

3. CALL FOR SYMPOSIUM PROPOSALS FOR 1996 PSA MEETING
</p>
<pre>
		 CALL  FOR  SYMPOSIUM  PROPOSALS

		PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE ASSOCIATION

		    FIFTEENTH BIENNIAL MEETING

</pre>
<p>
Members of the PSA are invited to submit proposals for symposia to be
presented at the 1996 PSA meeting.  Proposals must include sufficient
supporting material to permit the program committee to evaluate the
quality and interest of the symposium.  The proposal should include: (1) a
description of the topic and a justification of its current importance to
the discipline (about one or two pages); (2) titles and abstracts of
papers; (3) a list of participants and either vitae or short biographical
information for each; (4) addresses for each participant, with their
institutional affiliation, surface and email address, fax and telephone
numbers; also indicate who is the organizer to be the contact person for
communication with the committee.
</p>
<p>
The version of symposium papers accepted for publication will be
restricted to 5000 words and will appear in a supplemental issue of
Philosophy of Science in 1997.  Organizers should make it clear to
philosophers that by accepting the invitation to participate in a
symposium they agree to participate in the meeting and to deliver a
manuscript for consideration for publication soon after the meeting.
Symposium organizers who wish to invite scientists who would not submit a
manuscript for publication should make that status clear in their
symposium proposal.
</p>
<p>
Symposium proposals should reach the chair of the program committee by
June 30, 1995.
</p>
<p>
The Program Committee consists of: Lindley Darden, Chair (University of
Maryland, College Park), Ron Amundson (University of Hawaii-Hilo), John
Earman (University of Pittsburgh), Daniel Hausman (University of
Wisconsin), Tim Maudlin (Rutgers University), W. H. Newton-Smith (Oxford
University), Rose-Mary Sargent (Merrimack College), Paul Thagard
(University of Waterloo).
