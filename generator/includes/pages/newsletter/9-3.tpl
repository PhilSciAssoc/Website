      1.
PSA 2004.  CALL for Symposium and
Workshop Proposals, Deadline: Nov. 1, 2003.
</p>
<p>
Philosophy of Science
Association Nineteenth Biennial Meeting: November
 18-21, 2004
</p>
<p>
Austin, Texas
</p>
<p>
Members of the
Philosophy of Science Association (PSA) are invited to submit proposals for
symposia and workshops to be presented at the PSA 2004 meeting in Austin, Texas, November 18-21.  Proposals must include sufficient supporting
material to permit the program committee to evaluate the quality and interest
of the symposium or workshop.
</p>
<p>
Symposia will follow the
traditional format, whereby the papers presented will be submitted for
consideration for publication in a supplementary issue of Philosophy of
Science.  The evaluation for publication
will be on entire sessions, that is, all papers in the session will be
published together.  All contributions
for symposia will be electronically archived, whether or not they are accepted
for publication.
</p>
<p>
Workshops follow a new
format, established at PSA 2002, and extended for PSA 2004.  There is no expectation that the papers
presented will be submitted for review for publication.  This format may be more attractive to
sessions involving participants from outside the philosophical community,
and/or for exploratory-stage research.
Authors may choose to have their papers archived in electronic form.  Some workshops may take the form of lunch
roundtables or mentoring sessions.
</p>
<p>
Proposals for both symposia and workshops should
include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The
title of the proposed symposium or workshop
</li>
<li>
A
description of the topic and a justification of its current importance to the
discipline (about one or two pages)
</li>
<li>
Titles
and abstracts of papers
</li>
<li>
A
list of participants and either an abbreviated curriculum vitae or short
biographical description for each
</li>
<li>
Addresses
of each participant, with the institutional affiliation, postal and e-mail
addresses, and telephone numbers.
</li>
<li>
Clear
statement of the name of the organizer (who may or may not be a proposed
speaker) for the purposes of communication with the Program Committee.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The PSA 2004 Program
Committee will strive for quality, variety, innovation and diversity on the program.  We encourage proposals in both traditional
and novel areas of philosophy of science.
Some suggestions for new topics for symposia or workshops:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How
should philosophy of science be socially relevant?
</li>
<li>
Risk
and emerging diseases (SARS, West Nile Virus, Bioterrorism)
</li>
<li>
Connections
(or lack thereof) between philosophy of physics/biology/chemistry
</li>
<li>
Teaching
philosophy of science
</li>
<li>
Social
dynamics of decision making
</li>
<li>
Quantum
information (cryptography, teleportation and computation)
</li>
<li>
Varieties
of theoretical mediators (models, structures, processes, idealizations)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The deadline for
Symposium and Workshop proposals is November
 1, 2003.  Decisions about acceptance will be made by
mid-January, 2004.
</p>
<p>
Submissions may be sent
EITHER by e-mail as an attachment in Word or PDF to psa2004@temple.edu OR
electronically at an interactive web site at http://www.temple.edu/psa2004
</p>

submission accepted for publication in Philosophy of Science will have to be
ultimately submitted in a Word-compatible format.  We encourage you to submit in such a format
initially, if at all possible.

This conference aims at a philosophical examination of medicine that goes
beyond the traditional applied-ethics model, using the tools of epistemology,
philosophy of science, metaphysics, political philosophy, and other disciplines
to explore a broad range of health-related issues, as well as the theoretical
bases and foundational controversies of medical science.  Key issues
include: the nature medical theories and evidence, the objective reality of
medical concepts, the nature of disease, the social process in producing
medical knowledge, the nature of mental health and illness, the concept of
personhood in medical and mental health settings, health and normality, the
role of values in medical research and practice, distributive justice and
health care, the role of medicine in a liberal democracy, and the role clinical
trials in medical research.
</p>
<p>
Submissions:  Two copies of your paper of
no longer than 3000 words and an abstract of no more than 200 words.  Papers on various philosophical topics
relevant to medical science are welcome.
