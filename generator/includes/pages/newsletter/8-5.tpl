     1.  Richard C. Jeffrey (1926
- 2002):  Tribute, by Brian Skyrms.

 </p>
<p>

Richard
Jeffrey died at home on November 9, after a long battle with lung cancer. He
was 76. Jeffrey's 1952 PhD thesis at Princeton
explored the treatment of uncertain evidence that later became famous as
Jeffrey Conditioning. In 1963, while he was a visiting faculty member at the Institute
for Advanced Study, he developed the main ideas of a novel theory of decision
in which both probability and value attach to each proposition describing the
world. This theory, together with Ethan Bolker's
representation theorem for it, are contained in Jeffrey's 1965 The Logic of Decision. Both Jeffrey
Conditioning and The Logic of Decision
were motivated by deep epistemological concerns, which formed the core of a
philosophy that Jeffrey called &quot;Radical Probabilism.&quot;
This was developed in a series of articles and in Probability and The Art of
Judgment (1992).
</p>
<p>

Jeffrey had a magic touch that produced enjoyable exposition of usually dry
subjects, which is evident in his Formal Logic, Its Scope
and Limits and in the more advanced text, Computability
and Logic (1974), which he coauthored with his good friend, George Boolos. At the time of his death he had just completed the manuscript
for a new book, Subjective Probability: The
Real Thing!
</p>
<p>
Richard Jeffrey taught at Stanford
 University,
City College of New York, University
 of Pennsylvania,
and Princeton
 University.
In recent years he spend part of his time in Princeton and part as Visiting Distinguished
Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science at the University of California,
Irvine. He was elected to the American
 Academy
of Arts and Sciences in 1994, and was president of the Philosophy of Science
Association from 1999-2000. He was the recipient of a number of international
awards and medals.
</p>
<p>
Dick Jeffrey was a delight to all who knew him. Everything was viewed with an
irrepressible sense of humor. He was without pretense, and when he ran across
it he was able to demolish it with a well-aimed quip. Acute philosophical
insights came out as jokes. His good humor prevailed over everything, even the
cancer. He lived his final years full of good spirits, kindness, and zest for
life.

Funding Opportunities at NSF.
Target dates:
Feb. 1, 2003; Aug. 1, 2003.

</p>
<p>

Funding Opportunities in
Science, Technology, Society at the U.S.
National Science Foundation
</p>
<p>
The next target date for submitting proposals to the Societal Dimensions of
Engineering, Science, and Technology (SDEST) program is February 1, 2003.  Societal Dimensions considers a wide variety
of proposals for research and
education about the interactions of engineering, science,
technology, and society.  The Ethics and Values Studies (EVS) component
supports examinations of the ethical and value dimensions in those
interactions.  The Research on Knowledge, Science and Technology (RST)
component supports research on the implications of social and strategic choices
that influence knowledge production and innovations.

&quot;Preparing a Proposal, What You Should Know!!!!!!!!&quot;
</p>
<p>
Information about submission procedures and the kinds of awards the program
makes, including professional development and graduate training efforts, is in
the program announcement, at <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf01152." rel="external">http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf01152.</a>

You can reach the SDEST program director Rachelle Hollander at <a href="mailto:rholland@nsf.gov" rel="email">rholland@nsf.gov</a>; phone: 703-292-7272.
Program director John Perhonis handles dissertation
proposals; he can be reached at  <a href="mailto:jperhoni@nsf.gov" rel="email">jperhoni@nsf.gov</a>;
phone: 703-292-7279.

</p>
<p>
Special Opportunities:
</p>
<p>
International:  The US and UK
programs on science, technology and society announce a unique opportunity to
support US-UK collaboration in research on:
science in governance and the governance of science, science
communication, science in the economy and the economics of science, science and
globalization, and science and gender, ethnicity, and the lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
Researchers wishing to cooperate must submit separate proposals to their own
national funding bodies.  In the U.K.,
that is the Science in Society Programme of the UK
Economic and Social Research Council - Science in Society Programme.
In the U.S.,
the Science and Technology Studies program and the Societal Dimensions of
Engineering, Science, and Technology program  are both encouraging submissions.
</p>
<p>
Proposals should identify the collaborating project in the other country,
explain the value added by transatlantic cooperation, and request coordinated
review.  For further information on specific submission requirements, US
researchers should contact Rachelle Hollander, or
Keith Benson at the STS program; e-mail: <a href="mailto:kbenson@nsf.gov" rel="email">kbenson@nsf.gov</a>; phone:
703-292-7283.  UK
researchers will find information at www.esrc.ac.uk.

competitions; many occur yearly.  Three areas of special interest to
researchers investigating issues in science, technology, and society are: Biocomplexity and the Environment, Information Technology, and  Nanotechnology.
All three can consider research proposals on social dimensions of relevant
scientific and engineering activities.
