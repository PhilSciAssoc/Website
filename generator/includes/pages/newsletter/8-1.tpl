FURTHER
DETAILS:

</p>
<p>
1. Call for Papers,
Philosophy of Science Association, Eighteenth-Biennial Meeting, 7-10 November
2002 Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
</p>
<p>
Members of the PSA are invited to submit papers to be
presented at the PSA 2002 meeting
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin
November 7-10, 2002.
Contributed papers may be on any topic in the philosophy of science. The deadline for submissions is 1 March 2002. Some papers will be
accepted for both presentation at the PSA 2002 meeting and publication in a
supplementary issue of Philosophy of Science,
other papers will be accepted just for presentation. Both types of accepted paper will be
electronically published prior to the meeting.
In each case, the Program Committee expects to make its decisions by 1 June 2002. Final versions of all papers accepted for
publication must be submitted by 15
 January 2003.
</p>
<p>
New Format
</p>
<p>
This year there is an
important change to note: We will be web archiving accepted papers and their
abstracts prior to meeting. We are going totally electronic for this
meeting.
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT: Any submission accepted for publication in Philosophy of Science will have to be
ultimately submitted in a Word-compatible format. We encourage you to submit in such a format
initially, if at all possible.
</p>
<p>
Submissions may be sent
EITHER by email as described above OR by means of our interactive web site at www.pitt.edu/~psa2002
</p>
<p>
The maximum recommended
manuscript length is 5,000 words, including footnotes and references. If the
text includes tables or figures, an appropriate number of words should be
subtracted from the limit. Submissions must include a 100-word abstract and a
word count. Format and citation style should match those of the journal, Philosophy of Science (see a recent issue
for details). Authors of accepted papers are expected to present abbreviated
versions of their papers, with a time limit of approximately twenty minutes
(plus discussion).
