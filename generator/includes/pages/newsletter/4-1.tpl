Subject: 1. EDITOR'S NOTE:
</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The
newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to
members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings of the Association, and information
about other meetings likely to be of interest to a broad range of the
membership.  It is NOT intended for ungoing discussions of intellectual
topics within philosophy of science.  If you have information that you
would like to submit for possible inclusion in a future issue of the
newsletter, please send it to the editor at psa@twinearth.wustl.edu.

2. Editorship of Philosophy of Science
</p>
<p>
Professor Philip Kitcher has indicated that he does not wish to be
considered for another term as Editor-in-chief of Philosophy of Science
when his current term expires on June 30, 1999.  With this notice, the
Governing Board of the Association solicits applications and nominations
for his replacement.  The Editor-in-chief is appointed by the Governing
Board for a five year term.  Officially that term will not begin until
July 1, 1999, but the new editor is expected to start managing the
refereeing and selection of articles no later than the beginning of 1999
and to become increasingly involved in the production process during the
course of the year.  Due to the fact that there are already papers in the
pipeline, the transition of editorship will necessarily be gradual.
</p>
<p>
The office of the Editor-in-chief is responsible for overseeing the
refereeing system for the journal, deciding which articles are to be
published, choosing those which will appear in a particular issue, copy
editing manuscripts to conform to the style of Philosophy of Science,
securing copyright transfer agreements from authors, obtaining reprint
orders, sending galleys to authors for proofing, creating a master galley
proof, proofing pages, and arranging for book reviews. The actual
performance of some of these responsibilities (securing copyright, sending
galleys to authors) is handled by staff at the University of Chicago Press
and the Editor's task is simply one of oversight.  Stan Walens will
continue to serve as Managing Editor and will do the copy-editing of
accepted manuscripts and correspondence with authors once a final
manuscript has been received.  The Editor appoints Associate Editors and
members to the journal's Editorial Board, subject to the Governing Board's
approval and also submits an annual report to the Executive Secretary for
transmittal to the Governing Board.  Article V of the PSA By-laws pertains
to the position of Editor-in-chief of Philosophy of Science.
</p>
<p>
When reviewing the credentials of applicants and nominees, the following
characteristics will be especially relevant:  1) broad interests in
philosophy of science; 2) a record of professional work in the field over
a period of at least ten years; 3) a home institution willing to support
the undertaking (e.g., by providing appropriate space, released time,
secretarial and editorial assistance); 4) colleagues who can provide
support; 5) commitment to keeping the journal non-doctrinaire with respect
to philosophical position; and 6) availability on the schedule and for the
term described above. All other things being equal, an individual with
some experience with the editorial process would be preferred.
</p>
<p>
The members of the selection committee are: William Bechtel, chair,
Washington University; Lindley Darden, University of Maryland; George
Gale, University of Missouri, Kansas City; Nancy Nersessian, Georgia
Institute of Technology; and Kenneth F. Schaffner, George Washington.
Nominations and applications should be sent to Professor William Bechtel,
Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology Program, Campus Box 1073, Washington
University, St. Louis, MO 63124 (email: bechtel@twinearth.wustl.edu)  Both
nominations and applications should include a vita and a letter discussing
the individual's qualifications for the position.  Evidence that
institutional support will be forthcoming may be preliminary but must be
provided. The selection committee will continue to consider applications
until the position is filled, but will begin considering applications
March 1, 1998.

3. Conference on Science, Technology, and the Rise of Nature
</p>
<p>
CALL FOR PAPERS
</p>
<p>
4S (Society for the Social Studies of Science) and ESAC (Environmental
Studies Association of Canada) announce a call for papers for "Science,
Technology, and the Rise of Nature", a jointly sponsored conference to be
held from Wednesday, October 28 to Sunday, November 1, 1998 at the Hotel
Halifax in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
</p>
<p>
Papers dealing with any topic in the broadly defined field of science and
technology studies are appropriate, and papers on the substantive theme of
the conference (the interface between science, technology and the
environment) are particularly encouraged. Abstracts must
be typed and not exceed
300-500 words in length.  Also include as many of the following as
possible:
title of the paper, name, present institutional affiliation (if any),
preferred mailing address, work and home phone numbers, fax number and
email. Send this information to Gary Bowden, Program Chair 4S/ESAC
Conference, Department of Sociology, University of New Brunswick, P.O. Box
4400, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, E3B 5A3.  Abstracts may also be
submitted via fax (506-453-4659) or email (glb@unb.ca).  Abstracts must be
received by Friday, February 20, 1998.
</p>

<p>
4. ERA/NSF Decision Making and Valuation for Environmental Policy program
</p>
<p>
The US Environmental Protection Agency and the US National Science
Foundation are continuing to cooperate in considering proposals
for research of interest to them.  The new announcement for the
Decision Making and Valuation for Environmental Policy program is
available on the World Wide Web at
</p>
<p>
http://es.inel.gov/ncerqa/rfa/98valrfa.html
</p>
<p>
The Decision-making and Valuation for Environmental Policy competition
encourages research on improving decision-making and understanding
diverse values in environmental policy and related public issues.
Within this component, priority will be given to research leading to
advances in valuing environmental quality and economic growth and in
improving environmental decisionmaking.
</p>
<p>
The program expects to spend about $2 million for grants, with a
projected award range from $60,000 to $125,000 per award per year, and
an approximate duration of 2 to 3 years. Field experiments, survey
research, and multi-investigator projects may be considered for a higher
funding level. Depending on the quality of proposals and the
recommendations from merit review, the sponsoring agencies expect more
than half the resources to be allocated to the component area of
benefits of environmental policies and programs.
</p>
<p>
Proposals in response to this announcement must be received by January
15, 1998. It is anticipated that awards will be made by Fall 1998.
Awards resulting from this competition may be made by either EPA or
NSF, at the option of the agencies, not the grantee.
</p>
<p>

Partnership for Environmental Research, please contact any one of the

7. Workshop Modern Mathematical Thought II
</p>
<p>
Joint Workshop at the University of Pittsburgh
and Carnegie Mellon University
</p>
<p>
Modern Mathematical Thought II:
Historical and Philosophical Approaches
</p>
<p>
MAY 1 - MAY 4, 1998
</p>
<p>
The workshop is the second in a successful collaboration between the
editors of David Hilbert's unpublished papers and a select group of
historians and philosophers of mathematics.  The aim is both to further
the assessment of Hilbert's foundational work on mathematics and physics,
its background and impact, and to highlight alternative approaches to
conceptual problems in the philosophy and history of mathematics in which
these disciplines can complement each other.  The workshop will draw
together an international group of philosophers, historians and logicians
of diverse perspectives;  among them will be: Karine Chemla, William
Ewald, Michael Friedman, Emily Grosholz, Michael Hallett, Ralf Haubrich,
Jesper Lutzen, Ulrich Majer, Kenneth Manders, Charles Parsons, Tilman
Sauer, Wilfried Sieg, Howard Stein, William Tait, and Mark Wilson.
