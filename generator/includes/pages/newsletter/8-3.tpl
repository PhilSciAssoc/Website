      1.  James T.
Cushing.  With deep sadness and regret, the University of Notre Dame's Program in History and Philosophy of
Science, along with the Departments of Physics and Philosophy, and the Reilly Center for Science, Technology, and
Values, announces the death on Friday, March 30, of our dear friend and
colleague, James T. Cushing.
</p>
<p>


Jim's
own important work in the history and philosophy of physics and his many
contributions to the broader discipline of the history and philosophy of science,
both here at Notre Dame and internationally, will be warmly remembered.
</p>
<p>
Jim's widow, Nimbi, asks that, in lieu of flowers or other such, donations be sent to:
 </p>
<ul class="address">
 <li>Cushing Memorial Prize</li>
 <li>c/o Program in
History and Philosophy of Science</li>
 <li>346 O'Shaughnessy</li>
 <li>University of Notre Dame</li>
 <li>Notre Dame, IN 46556</li>
 </ul>
<p>
This will be an annual prize for work in the history and foundations of
physics.  Further details will be announced in the near future.

INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL:  Philosophy and Probability, University of Konstanz, Germany, September
 15-22, 2002.   The application deadline is extended to July
31.

</p>
<p>

No area of analytical philosophy has remained
impervious to probability theory over the last decade.  Metaphysicians
share an interest in probabilistic causation with statisticians and computer
scientists, philosophers of science construct Bayesian analyses of many of the
standard puzzles in their field, political philosophers are being informed by
work in rational choice theory, and even philosophers of religion are
constructing probabilistic analyses of the argument of evil.  And yet, the
curricula of many philosophy departments have remained resistant to change and
have not incorporated this new development at their own peril.  We have
invited Branden Fitelson
(Stanford University, USA), Alan HÃ¡jek (California
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, USA), Christian List (Nuffield College,
University of Oxford, UK) and Jon Williamson (King's College London, UK), who
are leading experts in the area of philosophy of probability, to come to teach
during the summer school in the University of Konstanz.
Topics covered include the role of probability in confirmation theory and
epistemology, alternative interpretations of probability and the meaning of
conditional probability, the role of probability and causation in artificial
intelligence, and probability in social choice and democratic theory.  We
will start with an introductory lecture on probability for those who are in
need of a refresher course.
</p>
<p>
We will also reserve some time slots for students who would like to make a
presentation of their own research.  Please indicate if you wish to do so
in your application letter.
</p>
<p>
To apply to the summer school, please send us an e-mail explaining why you are
interested in participating and attach a short CV. The application deadline is extended
to July 31.  The
tuition fee is Euro 100 for early registration (before July 15) and Euro 125
for on-site registration.  The costs for accommodation and travel are
additional.  We will facilitate accommodation arrangements. For details
concerning the application procedure, visit the summer school's URL: <a href="http://www.uni-konstanz.de/struktur/zwn/summerschool2002/" rel="external">http://www.uni-konstanz.de/struktur/zwn/summerschool2002/</a>
</p>
<p>


The summer school is being hosted by the
research group &quot;Philosophy, Probability and Modeling&quot; in the University of Konstanz and organized by Luc Bovens (University of Colorado at Boulder), Stephan Hartmann (University of Konstanz) and Nils
Hesse (University of Konstanz).

CALL FOR PAPERS: Acta Biotheoretica
is an international peer-reviewed journal on theoretical biology published
since 1935. From the inception of the journal theoretical biology has been
given a broad interpretation, as comprising both the mathematical and the
philosophical foundations of biological science. Acta
Biotheoretica is aimed at an interdisciplinary
readership of biologists, mathematicians and philosophers of science. Currently
the journal is published annually in four issues by Kluwer
Academic Publishers. This year volume 50 will be published.

</p>
<p>

Acta Biotheoretica
publishes articles on any topic in mathematical biology or philosophy of
biology. The journal is also open for contributions from closely related
fields, such as bioinformatics, and the mathematical and philosophical
foundations of biomedical science. Acta Biotheoretica publishes regular articles reporting on
original research (with a limit of 10,000 words), invited review articles, and
three types of short contributions (with a limit of 2,000 words): discussion
notes, Ideas in Theoretical Biology (short papers intended to serve as the
upshot for discussion), and book reviews.
</p>
<p>

All submissions are welcome. The Managing Editor especially invites
philosophers of biology/science to submit manuscripts for publication in Acta Biotheoretica. Researchers
in the early stages of their careers are also encouraged to submit
contributions.
