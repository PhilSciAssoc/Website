Subject: 1.  New Site for PSA Newsletter
</p>
<p>
The computer system on which the PSA Newsletter was housed, kasey, ceased
to function late in 1995.  Through the good services of George Gale and
his colleagues at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, we have been
moved to a new system, cctr.umkc.edu.  Below are new directions for
subscribing and signing off this system.  I have also been able, for the
first time, to make direct additions and delitions from the mailing list,
so for some, this may be the first copy of the newsletter you have
received.  I apologize for the delay in getting this issue out.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Subject: 2. EDITOR'S NOTE:
</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The
newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to
members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings of the Association, and information
about other meetings likely to be of interest to a broad range of the
membership.  It is NOT intended for ungoing discussions of intellectual
topics within philosophy of science.  If you have information that you
would like to submit for possible inclusion in a future issue of the
newsletter, please send it to the editor at psa@twinearth.wustl.edu.
</p>
<p>
Directions for subscribing and unsubscribing:
<code>Send an emailmessage with NO subject to psa-request@cctr.umkc.edu</code>
To subscribe, include the following as the ONLY line:
        <code>SUBSCRIBE PSA &lt;your name&gt;</code>
To unsubscribe, include the following as the ONLY line:

<p>
Subject 3. PSA96 Web Address:  Editor's Mea Culpa
</p>
<p>
In the last issue I included an incorrect web address for the PSA96 WWW
page.  The correct address is:
<code>
http://www.inform.umd.edu:8080/EdRes/Colleges/ARHU/Depts/chps
</code>
This is the Home Page of the Committee on History and Philosophy of
Science at the University of Maryland, on which you will find a link to
the PSA96 Web page.  This page will soon have information about the
invited symposia for the PSA meetings next November in Cleveland.  Further
information about the meeting will be posted there as it develops
</p>

<p>
Subject 4:  Fellowship opportunity at Center for Human Genome Research
</p>
<p>
There is a one year fellowship for philosophers, historians and cognate
others at the Center for Human Genome Research at the University of Utah.
The fellowship is funded by ELSI money and is for visiting scholars who
have research interests related to human genome research.  There is a one
course teaching requirement and the requirement to deliver a paper to the
ELSI core group at Utah.  All interested in more details should contact
Jeff Botkin at botkin@gene1.med.utah.edu.

<p>
This conference will explore the use of computational modelling to
understand and emulate inductive processes in science.  The problems
involved in building and using such computer models reflect
methodological and foundational concerns common to a variety of
academic disciplines, especially statistics, artificial intelligence
(AI) and the philosophy of science.  This conference aims to bring
together researchers from these and related fields to present new
computational technologies for supporting or analysing scientific
inference and to engage in collegial debate over the merits and
difficulties underlying the various approaches to automating inductive
and statistical inference.
</p>
<p>
