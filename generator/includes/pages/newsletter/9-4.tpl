<p>

The Executive Committee
of PSA voted to ask George Gale to stay on for a final term as Executive
Secretary.  George generously accepted.
His last day in office will be April
 30, 2008.
George says it would be a good idea if his replacement were in place a year
before, so that the transfer of power can be peaceful and smooth.  On
behalf of PSA, I want to express my gratitude to George for his hard work on
behalf of the Association.

First
Announcement:  A CONFERENCE to
mark the 10th anniversary of the death of

           Karl Popper (28.vii.1902-17.ix.1994).


</p>
<p>
PHILOSOPHY:
PROBLEMS, AIMS, RESPONSIBILITIES.
</p>
<p>
September 16th-18th
 2004, University of Warwick, England.


</p>
<p>
 In recent years many philosophers of different
persuasions have done their best to belittle the importance of philosophical
problems, &amp; even to deny their existence. Some have insisted on replacing
them with historical &amp; other factual questions that can be settled only
empirically, while others have set out to unmask them as mere puzzles induced
by the misuse of language, or even as rhetorical extravagances. The critical
rationalism of Karl Popper has consistently dissented from all these
anti-philosophical views. From The Logic
of Scientific Discovery (1934) to All
Life Is Problem Solving (1994) critical rationalism has emphasized the
central place of problems, including philosophical problems, in the growth of
knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Seventy years ago Popper put forward a provocative &amp; workable alternative
to the prevailing empiricist orthodoxy (positivism and inductivism) in the
theory of knowledge, and in the next two decades made radical advances in
social &amp; political philosophy (especially in The Open Society &amp; Its Enemies, 1945) and in a staggering
number of other fields. His books in English have remained continuously in
print  since they were first published. Yet he
never saw his ideas flourish as they deserved to.  Critical rationalism
must surely qualify as one of the greatest missed intellectual opportunities of
the second half of the 20th century.
</p>
<p>
Through a consideration of some of the problems to whose solution or
elucidation Popper contributed, especially the problem of induction and the
problem of maintaining a free society, this conference will illustrate the
value of philosophy as a discipline that is of abiding
relevance to all intellectual and human endeavours.
</p>
<p>

The conference, to be held at the University
 of Warwick, will consist of invited
lectures and a limited number of  sessions of
contributed papers. It is hoped that there will be plenty of overnight
accommodation available in local hotels and guesthouses or those who book
early. Those who wish to be kept on the mailing list should write to David
Miller, Department of Philosophy, University
 of Warwick, COVENTRY CV4 7AL,
 UK.
