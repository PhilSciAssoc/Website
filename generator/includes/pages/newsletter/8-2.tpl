New Journal:  Eighteenth-Century
Thought
</p>
<p>
Editor: James G. Buickerood, University
 of Missouri, St.
 Louis
</p>
<p>
     We are pleased to announce the launch of a
new  international,
interdisciplinary annual, Eighteenth-Century Thought. The goal of the journal
is to support the study of early modern thought through the publication of
research pertinent to the fields of philosophy, natural philosophy, medicine,
law, historiography, political theory, religion, economics, and the human
sciences as they were conceived and practiced from the mid seventeenth century
to the early nineteenth century. The journal will distribute such studies in an
overtly interdisciplinary forum, comprising not only papers on these subjects
of common interest to scholars of these various disciplines, but also papers
that themselves exemplify the highest standards of interdisciplinary research.
</p>
<p>
      Editorial correspondence and submissions
should be addressed to Professor James G. Buickerood,
Editor, Eighteenth-Century Thought, Department of Philosophy, University
 of Missouri, St.
 Louis, 8001
 Natural Bridge Road, St. Louis, MO
