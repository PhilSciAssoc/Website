PSA 2004.  CALL for Symposium and
Workshop Proposals, Deadline: Nov. 1, 2003.

</p>
<p>

Philosophy of Science
Association Nineteenth Biennial Meeting: November
 18-21, 2004

</p>
<p>

Austin, Texas

 </p>
<p>

Members of the
Philosophy of Science Association (PSA) are invited to submit proposals for
symposia and workshops to be presented at the PSA 2004 meeting in
Austin, Texas, November 18-21.  Proposals must include sufficient supporting
material to permit the program committee to evaluate the quality and interest
of the symposium or workshop.

 </p>
<p>

Symposia will follow the
traditional format, whereby the papers presented will be submitted for
consideration for publication in a supplementary issue of Philosophy of
Science.  The evaluation for publication
will be on entire sessions, that is, all papers in the session will be
published together.  All contributions
for symposia will be electronically archived, whether or not they are accepted
for publication.

 </p>
<p>

Workshops follow a new
format, established at PSA 2002, and extended for PSA 2004.  There is no expectation that the papers
presented will be submitted for review for publication.  This format may be more attractive to
sessions involving participants from outside the philosophical community,
and/or for exploratory-stage research.
Authors may choose to have their papers archived in electronic form.  Some workshops may take the form of lunch
roundtables or mentoring sessions.

 </p>
<p>

Proposals for both symposia and workshops should
include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The
title of the proposed symposium or workshop</li>

<li>
A
description of the topic and a justification of its current importance to the
discipline (about one or two pages)</li>

<li>
Titles
and abstracts of papers</li>

<li>
A
list of participants and either an abbreviated curriculum vitae or short
biographical description for each</li>

<li>
Addresses
of each participant, with the institutional affiliation, postal and e-mail
addresses, and telephone numbers.</li>

<li>
Clear
statement of the name of the organizer (who may or may not be a proposed
speaker) for the purposes of communication with the Program Committee.</li>

 </ol>
<p>

The PSA 2004 Program
Committee will strive for quality, variety, innovation and diversity on the
program.  We encourage proposals in both
traditional and novel areas of philosophy of science.  Some suggestions for new topics for symposia
or workshops:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
How
should philosophy of science be socially relevant?
</li>
<li>
Risk
and emerging diseases (SARS, West Nile Virus, Bioterrorism)
</li>
<li>
Connections
(or lack thereof) between philosophy of physics/biology/chemistry
</li>
<li>
Teaching
philosophy of science
</li>
<li>
Social
dynamics of decision making
</li>
<li>
Quantum
information (cryptography, teleportation and computation)
</li>
<li>
Varieties
of theoretical mediators (models, structures, processes, idealizations)
</li>
 </ol>
<p>

The deadline for
Symposium and Workshop proposals is November
 1, 2003.  Decisions about acceptance will be made by
mid-January, 2004.

 </p>
<p>

Submissions may be sent
EITHER by e-mail as an attachment in Word or PDF to psa2004@temple.edu OR
electronically at an interactive web site at http://www.temple.edu/psa2004

 </p>
<p>

submission accepted for publication in Philosophy of Science will have to be
ultimately submitted in a Word-compatible format.  We encourage you to submit in such a format
initially, if at all possible.

Greenwood Publishing Group seeks authors for books in several new
reference series in the history of science, medicine, technology, and the
environment. Each of these series will be marketed and sold to high-school,
public, and college libraries, and the books are intended
for advanced high-school students, undergraduates, and the interested lay
public. The goal is to provide students and the public with a more
sophisticated and detailed historical introduction to topics of broad interest
than that which can be presented in textbooks or similar venues. The ideal
writing level would be a work based on a first-rate introductory university
lecture class on the topic.

</p>
<p>

Authors should have
a strong understanding of the discipline and possess an interest in reaching
out to an audience beyond that of the scholarly community. Authors will receive
a small advance and a standard royalty arrangement.

 </p>
<p>

Biographies of
Technologies<br />
This series consists of short illustrated
volumes (approximately 200 manuscript pages) that present narrative histories
of various technologies. The idea is to emulate a traditional biography by
focusing on one technology and covering everything from its &quot;birth&quot;
to its &quot;death&quot; (or to the present), with appropriate coverage of both
technical developments and social and cultural impacts and effects. Several
excellent volumes are already in development, but we are seeking additional
volumes on such topics as radio, photography, airplanes, household appliances,
and agricultural implements. Volumes on other technologies will be
considered.  Greenwood Guides to Great
Ideas in Science This series will include short illustrated volumes (approximately
225 manuscript pages) that address the historical development of the
fundamental concepts in science that are most frequently discussed in
high-school and undergraduate classes in the sciences. To avoid (as best as
possible) a completely whiggish discussion of this,
alternatives would be discussed, complexities examined, debates acknowledged,
&quot;wrong&quot; turns analyzed, etc. While focusing on the history of the
scientific idea, each volume will also feature interesting discussions of
relevant people, experiments, and events that will help ensure the on-going
curiosity of students and teachers. The volumes will be on such topics as the
structure of the atom, the cell, heredity, evolution, thermodynamics,
biological classification, the origin of the universe, etc.

 </p>
<p>

Science and
Technology in Everyday Life Health and Medicine in Everyday Life Nature and the
Environment in Everyday Life<br />
These three series will comprise volumes that
discuss how these phenomena related to everyday life during a particular
chronological period (e.g., ancient, early modern, 20th century) of either U.S.
or World history. The series will present information that will provide
students and non-experts with a basic understanding of how science, technology,
medicine, and the environment impacted the lives of individuals throughout
history. Each volume will be about 250 manuscript pages, and will contain 8 to
10 thematically organized chapters. The volumes will cover all relevant
geographical regions and all social classes as best as possible.
