 1. NEW SCIENCE STUDIES PROGRAM, University of Wisconsin-Madison.
</p>
<p>
This new SCIENCE STUDIES program is designed to encourage interdisciplinary
cooperation among UW-Madison faculty who make science, technology or
medicine
(STM) their object of study.  The University of Wisconsin-Madison is seeking
one or two tenure-track or tenured faculty beginning August 2000 for the new
program. Consideration of applications will begin February 7, 2000.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Candidates' specific fields or disciplines are less important than a
demonstrable commitment to research and teaching in the interdisciplinary
domain of science studies.

 3. CALL FOR PAPERS: Monist 84:2 (April 2001)<br />
                     Submission Deadline April 2000.
</p>
<p>
    Probability as a Guide to Life.
</p>
<p>
Fifty percent of all college graduates, but only twenty  percent of all
churchgoers, drink alcohol.  What is the probability that  Alma, a church-
going college graduate, drinks alcohol?  There is, as yet, no general
solution to the problem of the reference class, of which Alma's case is
an instance.  The problem is pervasive in the application of statistical
knowledge.
</p>
<p>
It is philosophical in nature: what grounds inference to single-case
probabilities from knowledge about the classes in which they fall?
According to Richard von Mises, a founder of the philosophical study of
probability, the very question is nonsense: probabilities apply only to
classes.  But the probabilities of classes are, in themselves, of no help
in decision and action, for it is single cases we face, and we face them
one at a time.
</p>
<p>
Will recent developments in the area of probabilistic causality help
solve this problem?  Or is the relationship between the reference class
problem and causality entirely superficial?  Is the problem purely a problem
for epistemology, as Hans Reichenbach suggested? Does the Bayesian treat
the reference class problem in a distinctive way? Can analysis of Simpson's
paradox throw light on the problem?  The present issue of the Monist will
be devoted to these and related issues in the foundations of probability.
