  4. Notes From the NSF, by Bruce Seely and John Perhonis, Program Directors,
Science and Technology Studies
</p>
<p>
[Editor's Note: For this IMPORTANT information, see the full letter in a
more readable and printable form at http://philosophy.wisc.edu/PSA/NSF.htm]
</p>
<p>
We would like to alert PSA members about funding opportunities at the
National Science Foundation's STS Program.  We also want to convey to
potential applicants a couple of concerns about difficulties found in recent
submissions.
</p>
<p>
The  Program reviewed 195 proposals in the Fall 2000 and Spring 2001 review
cycles, and made 67 awards, including 16 for dissertations.  In partial
response to the increasing number of proposals, the STS Program received a 7
percent budget increase for FY 2001, to $3,827,000.  The situation for FY
2002 is unclear, but projections are for flat budgets. Those interested in
learning about the Program's activities are invited to look at the Program
Announcement and other information on the STS Program's home page:
http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/sts/start.htm.
</p>
<p>
NOTES ON PROPOSALS TO STS
</p>
<p>
Over the past year, a number of proposals have given the STS Advisory Panel
(which reviews all proposals) and the Program cause for slight concern.  The
difficulties can lead to lower evaluations, but are easily correctable.  Our
goal is to enable you to produce the best proposals possible.
</p>
<p>
Dissertation Proposals
</p>
<p>
We are concerned that some of these proposals are not following NSF
guidelines.  A very few have omitted required elements or presented budgets
that do not adhere to the guidelines.  Other problems suggest that faculty
advisers have not carefully reviewed proposals with their graduate students.
The most common difficulties are awkward or unclear writing, very general or
weak work plans, and distracting grammatical and spelling errors.  A few
submissions included bibliographies that identified only the broad formative
or theoretical literatures from which students intend to build their
projects, and omitted citations to the specific subject content. These
difficulties undermine the confidence of evaluators in projects.  The
Advisory Panel and Program realize dissertation proposals cannot exhibit the
maturity of projects from established scholars.  But faculty advisers are
PIs on these projects for a reason, and proposals ultimately reflect upon
them.
</p>
<p>
Postdoctoral Fellowship Proposals
</p>
<p>
As with dissertations proposals, the applicant is the co-PI with the
sponsoring faculty member as PI.   These have increased in number in recent
years, and some share problems with the dissertations in terms of clarity
and bibliographies.  Equally a matter of concern has been postdoc proposals
that did not specifically justify the choice of the institution and
sponsoring faculty member in terms of the student's plan of research and
training.   A few proposals have failed to describe both the training
component and the research activity.  Finally, a number of postdoc proposals
have given short shrift to the student's work plan.  In the end, competitive
postdoctoral fellowship proposals are built through careful cooperation
between the applicant and the sponsoring faculty member.  The Program and
Advisory Panel worry that proposals not exhibiting such contact in the
preparation stage will lead to unsatisfactory postdoc experiences.
</p>
<p>
Current and Pending Support Statements
</p>
<p>
A number of recent STS proposals of all types have slighted the required
Statement on Current and Pending Support.  This document should include
information about other awards you have already received, as well as the
other organizations to which you plan to submit applications covering the
same ground as your NSF proposal.   We encourage multiple submission of
proposals, for NSF is always willing to work out sharing arrangements with
sponsors when both find a project meritorious.  While some organizations may
not allow this, the STS Program can more quickly deal with budgets from
multiple funding sources if we know about such possibilities from the
outset.  So please provide complete information on the Current and Pending
Support Form at the time of the initial submission.  And remember that
investigators have an obligation to notify the STS program as soon as they
learn that have been awarded funding for the same research project submitted
to NSF.

  6. Public Appeal for Feyerabend Archive Material
</p>
<p>
  In 1996 the Philosophical Archives of the University of Konstanz acquired
  the papers of Paul K. Feyerabend. The recent gift of a significant number
  of letters and documents of Paul Feyerabend by his former assistant
  Christian Thomas gives us reason to presume that there is still more
  material in the possession of people who worked with Feyerabend or
  exchanged letters with him.
</p>
<p>
  To prevent such material from being lost we kindly request all persons who
  own or know about letters, documents or unpublished writings by Paul K.
  Feyerabend to inform the Philosophical Archives at the address given
  below. If such persons wish to keep the original documents in their
  possession, it would still be very helpful to register their existence and
  to arrange an agreement with respect to their future use or at least to
  make copies of the originals.
</p>
<p>
  Although it is the principle and practice of the Philosophical Archives to
  make all its holdings easily accessible to all interested users, items
  that make direct and personal reference to individuals alive today are
  sequestered unless such individuals declare their willingness to make the
  documents publicly available. As a rule, such items are entered in the
  catalogue, but are not open to the users of the archives.
  Please feel free to ask about details of the Philosophical Archives as
  an institution.

  9. Ludus Vitalis, biannual journal of Philosophy of Life Sciences
   Edited in
   Mexico in Spanish, English and French, recently published its 14th number.
   This is a journal devoted to the study of and reflection on the
   metascientific (ontological, epistemological, methodological, ethical,
   historical, sociological) problems of such disciplines as biology,
medicine,
   anthropology, linguistics, behavioral sciences and cognitive sciences. Its
   foremost thematic lines are History and Philosophy of Evolutionist
Theories;
   Epistemology of  Life Sciences; Mind-Body relation, Knowledge, Behaviour;
   Paleoanthropology and Studies on Humankind; Technique and Nature.
   The journal has a distinctly philosophical character, analytical and
   critical by definition. Its editorial policy does not subscribe to any one
   philosophical posture, but is interested in the debate between different
   positions and accepts any standpoint as long as it is supported with the
   analytical and argumentative rigor of professional philosophy.
