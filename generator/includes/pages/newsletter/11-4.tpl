1. PSA 2006: Call for Contributed Papers. Deadline: March 1, 2006.
</p>
<p>
Members of the Philosophy of Science Association (PSA) are invited to submit
papers to be presented at the PSA 2006 meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia on
November 2-5. Contributed papers may be on any topic in the philosophy of
science. The PSA 2006 Program Committee will strive for quality, variety,
innovation and diversity on the program. We encourage papers in both traditional
and novel areas of philosophy of science.
</p>
<p>
The deadline for paper submissions is March 1, 2006. Some papers will be
accepted for both presentation at the PSA 2006 meeting and publication in a
supplementary issue of Philosophy of Science; other papers will be accepted just
for presentation. Both types of accepted paper will be electronically published
prior to the meeting. In each case, the Program Committee expects to make its
decision by mid-June, 2006. Final versions of all papers accepted for
publication must be submitted by January 15, 2007.
</p>
<p>
The maximum manuscript length is 5,000 words, including footnotes and
references. If the text includes tables or figures, an appropriate number of
words should be subtracted from the limit. Submissions must include a 100-word
abstract and a word count. Format and citation style should match those of the
journal Philosophy of Science (see <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~philsci/submit.html#finalts" rel="external">http://www.indiana.edu/~philsci/submit.html#finalts</a>
for details). Submissions should be prepared for blind review, with no
identifying information in the body of the paper or abstract. Your identifying
information can appear in the body of an e-mail (where the paper is an
attachment file) or will be requested online if you submit at the program
website.
</p>
<p>
Authors of accepted papers are expected to present abbreviated versions of their
papers, with a time limit of twenty minutes.
</p>
<p>
Submissions must be electronically submitted at <a href="http://philsci.org/PSA06/submit." rel="external">http://philsci.org/PSA06/submit.</a>
</p>
<p>
N.B. Any submission accepted for publication in Philosophy of Science will have
to be ultimately submitted in a Word-compatible format. We encourage you to
submit in such a format initially, if at all possible.
</p>
<p>
The program committee for PSA 2006 will take on a different form than in the
past. Instead of a single, relatively small, committee responsible for referring
all submissions, this year the program committee shall consist of 35
individuals, divided into a number of subcommittees based on area of
expertise. Each paper will be refereed by the appropriate subcommittee. The
program committee for PSA 2006, chaired by Cristina Bicchieri (University of
Pennsylvania) and J. McKenzie Alexander (London School of Economics), is as
follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Horacio Arlo-Costa (Carnegie Mellon University)</li>

VISU Vienna International Summer University
</p>
<p>
SWC Scientific World Conceptions
</p>
<p>
Since 2001 the University of Vienna and the Institute Vienna Circle have been
holding an annual two-week summer program dedicated to major current issues in
the natural and social sciences, their history and philosophy. The title of the
program reflects the heritage of the Vienna Circle which promoted
interdisciplinary and philosophical investigations based on solid disciplinary
knowledge.
</p>
<p>
As an international interdisciplinary program, VISU-SWC will bring graduate
students in close contact with world-renowned scholars. It will operate under
the academic supervision of an International Program Committee of distinguished
philosophers, historians, and scientists. The program is directed primarily to
graduate students and junior researchers in fields related to the annual topic,
but the organizers also encourage applications from gifted undergraduates and
from people in all stages of their career who wish to broaden their horizon
through crossdisciplinary studies of methodological and foundational issues in
science.
</p>
<p>
The summer course consists of morning sessions, chaired by distinguished
lecturers which focus on readings assigned to students in advance. Afternoon
sessions are made up of tutorials by assistant professors for junior students
and of smaller groups which offer senior students the opportunity to discuss
their own research papers with one of the main lecturers.
</p>

Philosophy and Economics
</p>
<p>
The course will deal with some fundamental problems of philosophy and economics,
spanning a wide range of topics from ethics to methodology and addressing both
substantial and formal, historical and topical issues. This approach will show
how broad the field of "Philosophy, Politics, and Economics" has become, as is
also reflected in our present interests as philosopher-economists. Alluding to
one of John Broome's titles, we could say that we will have both "economics out
of philosophy" and "philosophy out of economics". The course will be genuinely
interdisciplinary. In addition to material assigned for each lecture, general
background material (as a sort of introductory course to "philosophy and
economics") will be provided in electronic form to facilitate an
inter-disciplinary discussion.
</p>
<p>
The lectures will deal with the following topics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The economic approach to ethics.</li>
<li>Discounting the future.</li>
<li>Rational choice from a participant's and from the objective point of view.</li>
<li>Arrow and the economic approach.</li>
<li>Sen and Coase.</li>
<li>Trust, its role and its evolution.</li>
<li>Economising on virtue.</li>
<li>The economy of virtue.</li>
<li>David Hume's theory of government.</li>
<li>Esteem: conceptual and analytic.</li>
<li>No theory of justice.</li>
<li>Expressive voting</li>
<li>Public and private responsibility in health care and the limits of state action.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Cost of the program: EUR 880,-
</p>
<p>
Lodging in student dormitories is available at approximately EUR 250,- for the
whole duration of the course.
</p>
<p>
Applicants should submit:

<li>A one-page statement (in English), briefly outlining your previous work and your
reason for attending the VISU-SWC.</li>
<li>A (sealed) letter of recommendation from your professor, including some comment
on your previous work. This letter may also be sent directly by your professor.</li>
<li>A passport photo.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please make sure that all documents arrive in time because we can process only
complete applications.
Application form (available on our web site: <a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/ivc/VISU" rel="external">http://www.univie.ac.at/ivc/VISU</a>)
may be sent in advance.

<p>
Application deadline: January 30, 2006 (Later applications may be considered if
space is still available.)
</p>
<p>
A letter of admission together with a detailed syllabus will reach successful
applicants by mid-February, 2006.
</p>
<p>
The administration of VISU-SWC at the University of Vienna can assist the
candidates admitted in applying for funds and in the accreditation of the
course, but unfortunately, cannot offer financial assistance. However, for a few
gifted applicants who can demonstrate that, despite serious documented efforts,
they have not been able to obtain any financial support, in particular due to
economic difficulties in their own country, a tuition waiver grant, awarded by
the Institute Vienna Circle and the University of Vienna, will be provided.
