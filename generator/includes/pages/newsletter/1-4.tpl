5. Net Discussion on Sociology of Scientific Validity
</p>
<p>
SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY DISCUSSION GROUP
</p>
<p>
    Do you believe that in some historical periods some scientific communities
have improved the "competence of reference" or "validity" of some of those
beliefs on which they have achieved a new consensus?
</p>
<p>
    IF SO, THIS WAS A SOCIAL SYSTEM PRODUCT, DUE TO PERSUASION AND
    DISCRETIONARY JUDGEMENTS, I.E. WITHOUT ENTAILING PROOF.
</p>
<p>
    Do you believe that the achievement of new consensual beliefs of improved
validity happens more frequently in science than in other belief-sharing and
belief-transmitting social systems?
</p>
<p>
    IF SO, THIS MAY WELL BE DUE TO DISTINCTIVE ASPECTS OF THE SOCIAL SYSTEM OF
    SCIENCE, EVEN THOUGH NOT EPISTEMOLOGICALLY PRIVILEGED.
</p>
<p>
    As a field, "The Sociology of Scientific Validity" would attempt to
delineate those social system features which may help optimize the production
of new consensuses of improved competence.  It might be envisaged as a second
phase of the social-contructivist, relativist, interest-oriented, symmetrical
sociology of scientific knowledge.  It could be in part a comparative
sociology, comparing for example the social system of astrology at various
historical periods with that of astronomy.  It could study differences in the
valid productivity of different laboratories and national styles.
</p>
<p>
    There would be externalist principles:  What kind of socio-political
structures optimize validity-seeking science.  There would be internalist
principles: patterns of communication, rules of persuasion, norms, the degree
to which norms are lived up to, and the sanctions imposed when violated.  Also
relevant are sociological speculations as to the effect of current features of
scientific institutions on the selection of beliefs for competence of
reference:  e.g. requirements for the achievement of tenure, the effects of
tenure once awarded, editorial review processes, research funding, etc.  Some
of these may have negative effects.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to dialogue, which will be archived month by month, we hope to
archive a cumulative file of annotated citations.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps before you sign up to regularly receive all new messages, you
would like to browse in the currently accumulated text.  To do this you would
address:
    <code>LISTSERV@LEHIGH.EDU</code>
and make the body of the message (rather than the subject line) read:
    <code>GET SOCSCIVAL-L/ARCHIVES 9509</code>
</p>
<p>
    This refers to the September, 1995 accumulation.  This won't be much,
since we will go on line around September 21, 1995.  If you join in October,
1995, you would request 9510, and in a separate request, 9509, etc.  At the
start, the cumulation will mainly be annotated references.
</p>
<p>
    Without having yet joined, you may nonetheless insert comments into the
dialogue, by addressing your message to:
    <code>SOCSCIVAL-L@LEHIGH.EDU</code>
(Some of you may want to continue in this browsing status, rather than
automatically receiving each addition to the conversation as it is added.)
    To join as a regular member of the discussion groups, address:
    <code>LISTSERV@LEHIGH.EDU</code>

From then on, any new additions will come your way automatically, and while
they are on your screen you may add your comments without inserting an address
(Unfortunately, new subscribers will not automatically receive the month's

6. NSF Grant Opportunities in Science and Technology Studies
</p>
<p>
SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY  STUDIES PROGRAM
</p>
<p>
Science &amp; Technology Studies (STS) considers proposals for research on the
intellectual and social contexts that govern the development and use of
science and technology.  Besides traditional historical and philosophical
modes of analysis, this research may use theories and methods from the
social sciences and humanities, and information and analysis from the
natural and physical sciences and engineering.
</p>
<p>
STS supports research on the nature and processes of development in
science and technology (past and present) and the differences in the
nature of theory and evidence in various scientific and technological
fields.  It also supports research on the interactions between science and
technology and their impact on society, and on the interactions of forces
that influence science or technology.  It examines such topics as the
construction of scientific and technological knowledge and institutions;
the relations between science, government and other social institutions
and groups; and processes of scientific and technological innovation and
change.
</p>
<p>
Researchers whose projects are expected to contribute to understanding the
ethical and social values, policies, and obligations and responsibilities
that arise in the interactions of science, technology and society should
contact the Ethics and Values Studies Program of NSF.
</p>
<p>
Except for doctoral dissertation research, STS studies of medicine, public
health and society are not normally supported by NSF.  Researchers should
contact the National Institutes of Health and/or the National Endowment
for the Humanities for support of research in these fields.
</p>
<p>
MODES OF SUPPORT
</p>
<p>
Support for STS projects is available through grants including:
</p>
<p>
     1) STS Scholars Awards.  These normally support individual
researchers for part or all of an academic year, for summer research, or
for some combination of academic year and summer.  Awards allow up to
$15,000 for partial support of full time summer research and/or related
costs or up to $55,000 for partial support of one or more semesters (or
quarters) of full time academic year release time and related expenses.
Summer support is limited to no more than 2/9ths academic year salary.
Applicants may apply, where appropriate and justified in the proposal, for
a maximum of up to three summers' ($15,000*3) support and an academic year
($55,000) for up to $100,000.  Some graduate (max.  $12,000/year including
indirect costs) or undergraduate (max. $6,000/year including indirect
costs) research assistance, if justified, may be included within these
requests; investigators may also request support for a designated
postdoctoral researcher (max. $32,000 including fringe benefits and
indirect costs).
</p>
<p>
STS Scholars Awards are normally made to institutions.  PI's who cannot
apply through an appropriate institution, however, may apply as
individuals.  In the latter case, the applicant must be a US citizen,
national, or long-term resident (i.e. have permanent resident status).
</p>
<p>
     2) Grants for collaborative research or infrastructure projects.  STS
can also consider research projects which require several investigators,
or investigators and advisors, or collaboration among principal
investigators (PIs).  In preparing the budget for such collaborative
projects, program limits as described for scholars awards for salaries,
etc. for PI's should be followed: $55,000 maximum including fringes and
indirect cost for full-time academic year research and $15,000 maximum per
summer for each PI.  For projects that also require postdoctoral
researchers or graduate student assistants, see "Small Grants for Training
and Research" below.  Infrastructure projects may involve preparation of
reference works, editions of scientific papers, development of data bases
and graphics resources for public use, etc.  Electronic dissemination of
the results of such infrastructure projects should be the norm in STS
projects.
</p>
<p>
     3) Professional Development Fellowships (PDF) for researchers who
wish to improve and expand their skills in the areas of STS (for physical
and natural scientists and engineers) or in areas of science or
engineering (for researchers trained in ethics, history, philosophy, or
social science of science).  For example, historians, philosophers and
social scientists may use this award to work with a scientist or engineer
to learn the technical details of research in their area.  Alternatively,
scientists or engineers may use this award to work with a historian,
philosopher or social scientist to learn the methods of research in STS.
These awards provide as much as $50,000 (depending on the current salary
of the applicant) for support of a full-time academic year of study and
research in a field outside the applicant's current area of expertise.
They also provide up to $3,000 for travel (moving expenses could be taken
from this travel allowance if so desired, but there is no separate moving
allowance) and $3,000 for US host institution allowance.  There is no
dependents allowance.
</p>
<p>
PDFs must contain both a training and a research component.  Letters from
host scholars, describing their plans to work with the applicants, and
from the host institutions, agreeing to provide appropriate space and
facilities, must accompany these proposals.
</p>
<p>
     4) Post-doctoral Fellowships for STS researchers within 5 years of
receipt of Ph.D. The purpose of these fellowships is to enhance the
methodological skills of researchers in STS.  Consequently, applications
must contain both a training and a research component and the site for the
fellowship must be different from the institution where the fellow
received the Ph.D. degree. These awards provide $32,000 per year for up to
two years for support of full-time academic year of study and research.
They also provide up to $3,000/year for travel and expenses and
$3,000/year for U. S.  host institutions (a postdoc may hold the
fellowship outside of the US, but the NSF cannot pay institutional fees to
non-US institutions).  There are no dependents allowances and moving
expenses must be paid from the travel allowance.  Letters from host
scholars (i.e.  mentors) describing their plans to work with applicants,
and from the host institutions agreeing to provide appropriate space and
facilities, must accompany these proposals.  Letters of recommendation
from the fellow's dissertation supervisor must also be provided.  No
fellowship may begin until the Ph.D. granting institution has certified
that the fellow has completed all requirements for the degree. STS
Professional Development and Postdoctoral Fellowships provide a stipend
and travel allowance to the fellow and an activities support allowance to
the host institution.  The amount of the PDF stipend depends on the
fellow's prior earnings and work history; it can range from $30,000 to
$55,000.  The activities support allowance can be used to cover direct or
indirect costs associated with the fellowship.  To assure appropriate
processing, the cover sheet for these proposals should indicate "STS
Professional Development Fellowships" or "STS Postdoctoral Fellowship" in
the upper left hand box.  The individual applying answers the questions
and fills in the signature blocks at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>
Applicants for STS Professional Development and Postdoctoral Fellowships
must be US citizens, nationals or long term residents (i.e. have permanent
resident status).
</p>
<p>
     5) Doctoral Dissertation Research Grants provide funds for research
expenses not normally available through the student's university.  More
information on applying is available in "Grants for Improving Doctoral
Dissertation Research" (NSF 92-114).  The dissertation advisor is the
principal investigator on these applications; the doctoral student should
be listed as co-principal investigator.  No indirect costs are allowed;
and the usual limit on an award is $7,000 for research in North America
and $12,000 for work abroad. The proposal should include a letter of
recommendation from the faculty advisor evaluating the student's promise
as a researcher and the value and status of the proposed research.  If the
doctoral student will use the award for travel expenses to work with a
specialist, the proposal should provide a justification for this choice
and a letter from the specialist agreeing to work with the student.  The
proposal should include a statement indicating whether the student has
passed the preliminary qualifying exams and all course work required for
the dissertation.  These requirements must be met before an award will be
made.
   </p>
<p>
     6) Small Grants for Training and Research: "SGTR" awards are intended
to provide sustained research opportunities for graduate students and
post-doctoral fellows on important issues in STS.  One or more senior
investigators may propose a sustained course of study, research and
training (for from one to three years) on a subject of significance.
These training programs should have a specific research theme and the
proposal should indicate how the training will be organized around the
theme.  The grants can provide a maximum of $100,000 support for one
postdoctoral fellow and up to three graduate students to participate each
year.  For projects of more than one year, PIs may retain or change the
postdoc and graduate students.  In addition to providing a research theme
and plan, applicants should also indicate the efforts that will be made to
recruit women and minority students into the programs.  The budget for
training support belongs in the participant support costs section of the
budget form, and no indirect costs can be applied to these budget items.
Note: SGTR proposals will only be considered in the Fall of each year.
The target date for submission of these proposals is August 1. Within the
available funds, STS may only fund 2 or 3 of these SGTR's each year.
While these grants provide no support for the principal investigators,
PI's may be supported under existing grants or may concurrently submit a
regular research proposal.
</p>
<p>
          7) Conferences and Workshops:  STS can help to support national
or international conferences, symposia, and research workshops that enable
leading scientists, engineers, researchers in STS areas of support, policy
makers, and representatives of interested groups to develop, evaluate, and
share new research findings.  Proposals for conference or workshop support
should describe the need for the gathering, the proposed date and
location, topics and persons who will be involved, prior related meetings,
publicity, and expected outcomes.  These activities may, where justified,
be carried out as special sessions in regular meetings of professional
societies.  STS gives priority to those conferences and symposia that
promote interactions between researchers in STS and scientists and
engineers.  Concomitant support by several Federal agencies or private
organizations is encouraged.  Unless there is a very strong justification,
STS normally limits support for conferences and workshops to $10,000.
Other grant opportunities include support for instrumentation.  Proposals
can include requests for instrumentation costs.  Supplements to existing
awards may be requested for instrumentation such as CD-ROM readers,
portable computers for research in archives and libraries, etc.  Priority
will be given to requests that involve use by all faculty and graduate
students in a department.  The NSF does not normally support the purchase
of personal computers. GRANT ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATION OF FIXED AMOUNT
AND FELLOWSHIPS AWARDS STS Scholars Awards are fixed amount awards.  They
will be made on a fixed amount basis subject to the conditions of the
grant instrument and this Announcement.  A fixed amount award represents a
predetermined amount for NSF support of the proposed research without
regard to the subsequent costs of the project. Note to Institutional
Research Administrators:  grants awarded on a fixed amount basis are not
subject to Federal cost principles as contained in OMB Circular A-21.  As
part of the final report required by the grant general conditions, the
grantee will be requested to certify that the level of effort funded was
actually expended.  Grants awarded as a result of this announcement are
administered in accordance with the terms and conditions of NSF GC-1,
"Grant General Conditions," or FDP-II, "Federal Demonstration Project
General Terms and Conditions," depending on the grantee organization.
Copies of these and other NSF publications are available at no cost from
the NSF Forms and Publications Unit, phone (703) 306-1130, or via e-mail
pubs@nsf.gov (Internet). More comprehensive information is contained in
the NSF Grant Policy Manual (NSF 88-47, July 1989), for sale through the
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC
20402. The telephone number at GPO is (202) 783-3238 for subscription
information.
</p>
<p>
If the submitting institution has never received an NSF award, it is
recommended that appropriate administrative officials become familiar with
the policies and procedures in the NSF Grant Policy Manual which are
applicable to most NSF awards. If a proposal is recommended for an award,
the NSF Division of Grants and Contracts will request certain
organizational, management, and financial information. These requirements
are described in Chapter III of the NSF Grant Policy Manual.
</p>
<p>
Upon completion of the project a Final Project Report (NSF Form 98A),
including the Part IV Summary, will be required. NSF will send the form
with Part I information preprinted to the Principal Investigator (Project
Director) approximately one month prior to the grant's expiration date.
Applicants should review the sample form in the GPG prior to proposal
submission so that appropriate tracking mechanisms are included in the
proposal plan to ensure that complete information will be available at the
conclusion of the project.
</p>
<p>
When to Submit
</p>
<p>
Except for the SGTR program, which is limited to August 1 of each year
(see previous page) formal proposals should be sent to NSF by February 1
and August 1.  Express mail service is not necessary.  Generally,
proposals are reviewed and the results communicated to applicants within
six months of those target dates.  Until a decision is announced, no
information can be provided on the probability of support.
</p>
<p>
What to Submit
</p>
<p>
For the STS program, 20 copies (19 to the "PPU," one to the Program

Proposal Review
</p>
<p>
Proposals will be reviewed in accordance with established Foundation
procedures and the four general criteria described in GPG.  Normally,
proposals are submitted to a two stage review process:  merit review from
knowledgeable researchers followed by review by a panel made up of
historians, philosophers and social scientists who study science and
technology.  In preparing a proposal, PI's should recognize the
differences in these two kinds of review:  merit review from specialists
and panel review by researchers who look at the contribution the project
may make to questions of interest to the broader STS community.  PI's are
welcome to suggest a list of merit reviewers.  The PI may also request
that the proposal not be sent to certain reviewers (no explanation is
needed for such a request).  These suggestions should be sent in a letter
separate from the formal proposal.  The STS program will do its best to
use some (but not all) of the suggested reviewers and avoid if possible
those who the PI asks not to review.  It is not always possible, however,
to use suggested reviewers or to avoid others.
