1. EDITOR'S NOTE
</p>
<p>
The PSA Newsletter is published electronically on an "as needed" basis by
the Philosophy of Science Association to disseminate information.  The
newsletter is moderated and is restricted to information pertinent to
members of the Association (e.g., official business of the Association,
information about upcoming meetings of the Association, and information
about other meetings likely to be of interest to a broad range of the
membership.  It is NOT intended for ongoing discussions of intellectual
topics within philosophy of science. Please send information for possible
inclusion in a future issue of the newsletter to <a href="mailto:mforster@facstaff.wisc.edu" rel="email">mforster@facstaff.wisc.edu</a>.  It
would be helpful to include the phrase "PSA Newsletter" somewhere in the subject
title (so that your email message may be filtered into a special folder and/or
searched for electronically).

2. Apology
</p>
<p>
I apologize to both Deborah Mayo and Jeffrey Bub for the announcement concerning
the Lakatos Prize in the last issue of the PSA Newsletter.  I simply included an
item that was sent to me about Deborah without attention to the non-professional
way in which it was composed and without awareness that Jeffrey had also
received the Lakatos Prize for his book INTERPRETING THE QUANTUM
WORLD (Cambridge University Press) 1998. The full announcement from the LSE as
well as their acceptance lectures can be found at
<a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/events/philos-17-03-99.htm" rel="external">http://www.lse.ac.uk/events/philos-17-03-99.htm</a>

3. New Newsletter Editor
</p>
<p>
I am extremely pleased to announce that Malcolm Forster of the University of
Wisconsin will be the new editor of the PSA Newsletter, commencing with the next
issue.
</p>
<p>
Malcolm Forster first caught the philosophy of science bug in New
Zealand as an undergraduate, after which he studied the history of
Copernican astronomy in Poland and received a Ph.D. in philosophy of
science from the University of Western Ontario, Canada, in 1984.  After
holding a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Monash University, he joined the
philosophy department at University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1987, where he
is currently Professor of Philosophy.  Recent interests include the
foundations of statistics, parsimony, curve-fitting, causal modeling,
statistical physics, cognitive science, and the general methodology of
science.  His homepage is at <a href="http://philosophy.wisc.edu/forster." rel="external">http://philosophy.wisc.edu/forster.</a>

Please send information for possible inclusion in a future issue of the
newsletter to <a href="mailto:mforster@facstaff.wisc.edu" rel="email">mforster@facstaff.wisc.edu</a>.  It would be helpful to include
the phrase "PSA Newsletter" somewhere in the subject title (so that your
