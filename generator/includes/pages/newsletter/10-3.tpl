     7.   Cushing Memorial Prize Nominations,
2004-2005.


</p>
<p>
The
family, students, friends, and colleagues of Jim Cushing are pleased once again
to solicit nominations for the James T. Cushing Prize in the History and
Philosophy of Physics.
</p>
<p>
This annual prize is intended to recognize and reward the work of younger
scholars. The next winner will receive $1,000 and an invitation to deliver a
paper in Notre Dame's History and Philosophy of Science Colloquium series
during the 2005-2006 academic year. Eligible are all papers
in the history and philosophy of physics published by a younger scholar within
the three years prior to the nomination (e.g., for the 2004-2005 competition,
no earlier than September, 2001). Work is eligible only by nomination. While we
offer no explicit definition of the term &quot;younger scholar,&quot; our
intention is to favor work produced by scholars who are no more than about five
years past the completion of the Ph.D. or, in a comparable way, new to the
fields of the history and philosophy of physics, in recognition of Jim's
well-known role as a nurturer of younger talent in the profession.
</p>
<p>
A nomination should consist of a brief description of the significance of the
nominated work and such information about the author as the nominator might
think helpful to the evaluation committee, such as an abbreviated c.v.
The deadline for receipt of nominations is January
 15, 2005.

</p>
<p>
Nominated work will be evaluated by a committee of three people drawn from the
members of the Advisory Committee. The winner will be announced in April 2005.
</p>
<p>
Nominations will be accepted by mail, fax, email.
