 1. PSA ELECTION RESULTS
</p>
<p>
 In the most recent PSA election, Harold Brown (Northern Illinois)
 and Sandra Mitchell (Pitt) were re-elected to their second and last terms
 on the governing board. Elected to new and first terms were Jeffrey Bub
 (Maryland) and Elisabeth Lloyd (Indiana).
</p>
<p>
 Governing board terms are two years in length.
</p>
<p>
 In the elections to nominating committee, Patricia Kitcher (Columbia),
 Richard Healy (Arizona) and John Worrall (LSE) were elected to serve
 two-year terms; Kitcher will serve as chair of the committee.
</p>
<p>
 The Association is lucky to have had such an excellent slate of candidates
 for this election. Good candidates provide good officers, which makes PSA
 run well. Thanks to everyone who stood for election! I'm looking forward
 to working with everyone.
</p>

 2. New NSF Funding Opportunities in Science &amp; Technology Studies
</p>
<p>
 As the National Science Foundation continues to channel much support for
 research and training through new cross-disciplinary initiatives -- as
 opposed to traditional disciplinary-based programs, such as the Science &amp;
 Technology Studies Program (STS) -- scholars in all fields have learned
 that these special initiatives often provide unusually rich opportunities.
 Two recently-announced special competitions seem of great potential
 interest to those practicing history, philosophy, and social studies of
 science and technology.
</p>
<p>
 The first, "Enhancing Infrastructure for the Social and Behavioral
 Sciences," was recently announced through a formal Program Announcement
 issued by the NSF Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic
 Sciences (which houses the NSF STS Program).  This competition embodies a
 revision of a competition last held late in 1998 and offers support for a
 wide range of activities, including those that will "collect data from
 surveys, experiments, or administrative records; case or historical
 records; or objects of investigation (archaeological items, for example)
 [in a form] that will support broad-based investigations into the most
 important scientific questions facing social and behavioral science in the
 next decade."  Much further information about this competition appears in
 the formal Program Announcement, most readily available at
 http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/ses/infra/start.htm.  Proposals must be submitted
 to NSF by August 4, 2000.
</p>
<p>
 The second, a solicitation for proposals addressing issues relating to the
 development of an "Information Technology Workforce," was announced
 recently through a "Dear Colleague Letter" issued by the NSF Directorate
 for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.  Among other topics,
 this competition especially seeks proposals that revolve around three
 basic themes -- (1) Environment and Culture; (2) IT Educational Continuum;
 and (3) IT Workplace -- and that address research questions related to the
 under-representation of women and minorities in the IT workforce.
 Multi-disciplinary collaboration among researchers in all fields are
 encouraged, and proposals must be submitted to NSF by June 22, 2000.  The
 "Dear Colleague Letter" is most readily available at
 http://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/getpub?nsf0077.
</p>
<p>
 Each of these Websites provides the names and e-mail addresses of those
 overseeing these competitions, from whom additional information may be
 requested.  Potential applicants may also contact the NSF STS Program
 Officer, Michael M. Sokal, at msokal@nsf.gov.

 3. CALL FOR PAPERS. Conference on "Value-Free Science:
                                     Ideal or Illusion?"

<p>

 Fausto-Sterling, Michael Root, and many others. Paper length: 10 pages.
 Submission deadline: November 1, 2000. Send papers to Harold Kincaid,

 4. NEW NSF STS PROGRAM DIRECTOR
</p>
<p>
 Bruce E. Seely, Professor of History at Michigan Technological University,
 will become the next Director of the National Science Foundation's Science
 &amp; Technology Studies Program, early in August 2000.  Bruce has written
 extensively on the history of American technology;  he is perhaps best
 known for his studies the role of engineers in 20th-century transportation
 policy making and his research on the history of American engineering
 education.  He has previously served the NSF STS Program as a reviewer, a
 panelist, and a member of the program's early-1990s Committee of Visitors.
 He brings to the position extensive administrative experience derived from
 his current service as President of the MTU Faculty Senate and, more
 importantly, from his six-year term as Secretary of the Society for the
 History Technology.  As SHOT Secretary, Bruce worked closely with members
 and officers of all U.S.-based organizations that promote research and
 teaching in all areas of the history, philosophy, and social studies of
 science and technology, and at NSF he will build effectively on this rich
 experience.
</p>
<p>
 In assuming his position at NSF, Bruce will take on the full portfolio of
 responsibilities assigned to all NSF Program Officers.  He now looks
 forward to working with all members of the extremely varied scholarly
 community that the NSF STS Program has served so well for many years.
</p>
<p>
 Bruce will succeed Michael M. Sokal, who will complete his two-year
 "Rotatorship" in the position this summer.  Mike will return to his
 permanent position as Professor of History at Worcester Polytechnic
 Institute.

 6. A NEW JOURNAL AND A NEW BOOK SERIES
</p>
<p>
 The title of the journal is Brain and Mind: A Transdisciplinary Journal
 of Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy. Kluwer has set up a web site for
 the journal on their Journals Homepage. The site contains information
 about the journal's aims and scope , the inaugural editorial board,
 instructions for authors (currently being expanded), and subscription
 information. The first issue of the first volume should be out April 2000;
 each annual volume will contain three issues. The journal's site can be
 reached directly at www.wkap.nl/journals/bam
</p>
<p>
 In conjunction with the journal, Kluwer Academic Publishers will also
 start a book series, "Studies in Brain and Mind." This series will publish
 book-length manuscripts on interdisciplinary topics of interest to
 neuroscientists and neurophilosophers. It also has a site on Kluwer's web
 page, which can be reached directly at www.wkap.nl/series.htm/IBAM
