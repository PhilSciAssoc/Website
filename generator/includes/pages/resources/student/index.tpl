		<p>
			York University is pleased to announce a new Graduate Program in Science and Technology Studies.
			The Program, currently under review by the province, is still pending approval.
			We anticipate that it will be approved in time for us to launch the program next academic year (2009-2010).
			We are now inviting applications to the Program, with a deadline of February 15, 2009.
			The Graduate Program in Science and Technology Studies offers advanced training leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees.
			Drawing upon the demonstrated expertise of a wide range of faculty members within York University's undergraduate Science and Technology Studies program, and related areas of study at York, the graduate program aims to provide highly qualified students with a unique opportunity of doing specialized academic work focusing on the critical role of science and technology, both past and present.
			Research in the field applies the methods and theories of the social sciences and cultural studies to the examination of technology and scientific knowledge and practice.
			The program's mandate is to produce graduates equipped to utilize the rich tools afforded by interdisciplinary scholarship in science and technology studies, with an emphasis on four fields: Biosciences and Biotechnologies; Human-Machine Interactions; Public Science; Physical Systems.
			Application information is available <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/gradsts/howtoapply.html" rel="external">here</a>.
