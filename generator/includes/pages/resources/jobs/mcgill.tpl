<a id="top"> </a><h1>Wolfe Chair in Scientific and Technological Literacy, McGill University</h1>
<p>
The Faculty of Arts invites applications for the Wolfe Chair in
Scientific and Technological Literacy. Established through a generous
gift from a family foundation, the purpose of the Chair is to encourage
better understanding of scientific and technological concepts across the
general undergraduate student population, undertake research to provide
broad and fundamental insights into the crucial importance of science
and technology in society, and train graduate students to advance this
field of study.
</p>
<p>
The Wolfe Chair will be expected to direct an academic and research
program designed to ensure that students become familiar with critical
scientific and technological concepts and terminology, including the
scientific method and the importance of rigorous experimental controls
in the design and evaluation of scientific and technical claims; to
explore the social, cultural, ethical, economic, and political impact of
scientific and technical innovation; and to promote a broad
understanding of the scientific and technological basis of 21st
century society, including the role of new technologies. The Wolfe Chair
will also have the opportunity to play a leading role in the development
of a new interdisciplinary program in science, technology and public
policy.
