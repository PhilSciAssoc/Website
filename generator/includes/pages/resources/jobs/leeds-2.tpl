<p>
The University of Leeds, Faculty of Arts, School of Humanities, seeks to 
hire a Lecturer in Epistemology, broadly construed to include (e.g.) 
specialists in the history of the subject and candidates whose research 
engages with issues in philosophy of science (Job Reference: ARTHM0009). 
The position will incorporate undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, 
some thesis supervision, and some non-teaching administrative duties. 
With a research record and teaching experience commensurate with career 
stage, the successful candidate should have completed or submitted a PhD 
by the beginning of the appointment. The successful candidate will have 
the ability to make an outstanding contribution to the research life of 
the department, and to Philosophy's REF 2014 submission. Post must 
commence no later than 1 September 2012 (or sooner if required to do so 
in discussion with the School). Candidates are encouraged to apply for 
more than one Philosophy position where appropriate. We particularly 
welcome applications from candidates belonging to groups that have been 
traditionally underrepresented in philosophy, including but not limited 
to women and ethnic minorities. For more information on Philosophy at
