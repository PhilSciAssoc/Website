<a id="top"> </a><h1>Tier I (Senior) Canada Research Chair, University of Alberta</h1>
<p>
The Department of Philosophy, in the Faculty of Arts at the University 
of Alberta, has been authorized to search for a Tier I (Senior) Canada 
Research Chair in Epistemology and Metaphysics, broadly construed to 
include philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of 
science (natural, cognitive, life, mathematical) as well. We invite 
applications from exceptional scholars with a strong record of research 
and teaching in any of these areas, whatever their theoretical or 
methodological commitments. Other areas of research and teaching 
specialization or competence are open. A PhD in Philosophy, or 
equivalent, is required.
</p>
<p>
The successful applicant will be nominated by the University for a 
Canada Research Chair and will also be appointed as a regular senior 
faculty member.  The Canada Research Chairs Programme was established by 
the Canadian Government to foster world-class research excellence. As 
stated in the Terms of Reference <a href="http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca" rel="external">http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca</a>, 
"Tier I Chairs, tenable for seven years and renewable are for 
outstanding researchers acknowledged by their peers as world leaders" in 
their fields. Nominations for Canada Research Chairs are subject to 
review by the CRC Secretariat, and appointment as a Canada Research 
Chair is conditional upon their approval.
</p>
<p>
Responsibilities will include undergraduate and graduate teaching, 
graduate supervision and normal administrative committee work, as well 
as maintaining an original and innovative research programme. However, 
the teaching load for a Canada Research Chair will be two one-term 
courses per year instead of the four one-term courses per year for 
regular faculty. The appointment will be with tenure, at the level of 
either full Professor or senior Associate Professor.
</p>
<p>
Salary is commensurate with qualifications and experience, and, in the 
case of Canada Research Chairs, carries a supplement that may be taken 
as taxable salary or tax free research grant or a combination thereof. 
The benefit package is comprehensive.
</p>
<p>
For full consideration, the closing date for receipt of applications is 
January 15, 2012. The position starting date is as early as July 1, 
2012, but is negotiable.
</p>
<p>
Applicants should send curriculum vitae, a letter describing their 
interest in the position, including a brief statement of their research 
plans, and the names of at least three referees to be consulted, to:
