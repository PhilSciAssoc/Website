The Yale University Department of Philosophy has a possible opening for a
one-course one-semester visitor for the Spring of 2011. The ideal applicant
would be in a position to teach a  mid-sized (75-100 student) lecture course in
Philosophy of Physics, though we may consider applications from candidates who
are prepared to teach a similarly-sized lecture course in another area in
Philosophy of Science or MEML that would complement our other curricular
offerings. The course is currently scheduled to meet on MW 1:30-2:20, but the
time/days could be altered if necessary.

Applicants MUST have a PhD in Philosophy (with defense no later than January
2011), and documented evidence of success in teaching.
