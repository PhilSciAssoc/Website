Visiting Fellowships, Sydney

<a id="top"> </a><h1>Call for Applications for Visiting Fellowships at the Sydney Centre for the Foundations of Science</h1>
<p>
We are currently inviting applications for one-semester visiting 
fellowships at The University of Sydney, for either second semester 
(August to November) 2013 or first semester (February to May) 2014. 
This program is associated with The Sydney Centre for the Foundations 
of Science (SCFS), a research centre promoting work into the logical, 
philosophical, and historical foundations of science (further details 
below). We are hoping to receive applications from leading historians 
and philosophers of science (including the special sciences and 
biomedical sciences) at any post-PhD career stage. This is the sixth 
round of such fellowships and we anticipate being able to offer them 
each year.
</p>
<p>  
Up to four fellowships are available, and each fellowship will come with 
a travelling allowance of up to AUD 6,000. These fellowships will 
provide opportunities for academics on sabbatical from their home 
institution to spend a semester in a productive and collegial research 
environment (in a beautiful city), to work with members of the SCFS and 
with other visiting fellows. It is important that the applicant has a 
position at their home institution that extends beyond the term of the 
intended stay in Sydney and is on salary from their home institution for 
the duration of their intended stay. The allowance is to help offset 
some of the travelling and living-away-from-home expenses; it is not a 
salary. The successful applicants will be expected to work on a specific 
research project currently being conducted in the SCFS. See the SCFS 
website for current research projects. One of the aims of the SCFS is to 
strengthen international links in history and philosophy of science, so 
expressions of interest from researchers outside Australia are 
particularly encouraged.

<p>
Applications should including a cover letter, a CV, an indication of 
which of the current research projects you intend to work on and what 
your contribution to that project will be. Applications should be sent 
electronically to:
