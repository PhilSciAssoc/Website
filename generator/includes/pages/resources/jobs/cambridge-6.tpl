<p>
Applications are invited for two postdoctoral fellowships in the area of 
philosophy of cosmology, one to be held at Cambridge University and one 
to be held at Oxford University, starting 1 Jan 2013 to run until 31 Aug 
2014. The two positions have similar job-descriptions and the deadline 
for applications is the same: <strong>18 April 2012</strong>.

is led by Joe Silk, Simon Saunders and David Wallace, and that at 
Cambridge by John Barrow and Jeremy Butterfield.

These appointments are part of the initiative 'establishing the 
philosophy of cosmology', involving a consortium of universities in the 
UK and USA, funded by the John Templeton Foundation. Its aim is to 
identify, define and explore new foundational questions in cosmology. 
Key questions already identified concern:
</p>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>The issue of measure, including potential uses of anthropic reasoning</li>
  <li>Space-time structure, both at very large and very small scales</li>
  <li>The cosmological constant problem</li>
  <li>Entropy, time and complexity, in understanding the various arrows of time</li>
  <li>Symmetries and invariants, and the nature of the description of the universe as a whole</li>
</ul>
<p>
Applicants with philosophical interests in cosmology outside these areas will also be considered.
