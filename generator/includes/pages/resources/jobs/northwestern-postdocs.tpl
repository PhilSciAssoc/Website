<p>
The Science in Human Culture Program (SHC) at Northwestern University 
invites applications for two-year postdoctoral fellowships in the 
contextual study of science, technology, or medicine, to run September 
2012 - August 2014. Two Fellows will be selected. Applications are 
welcome from scholars who study science, technology, or medicine from a 
variety of historical, philosophical, sociological, anthropological, or 
literary perspectives. Each Fellow will be affiliated with both the SHC 
program and an appropriate disciplinary department (History, Sociology, 
Philosophy, Anthropology, etc.). Fellows will pursue a program of 
independent scholarship and teach two one-quarter undergraduate courses 
each year: a seminar and a lecture course. They will also help organize 
and run the SHC visiting lecturer series. Applicants must complete all 
the requirements for the Ph.D. before September 1, 2012 or have received 
their degree within the last five years.
The annual stipend is $46,000, plus $3,100 per year to fund research and 
conference travel. In order to ensure full consideration, all 
application materials must be received by January 15, 2012. Applicants 
should send the following materials in electronic form only, in PDF 
format by email attachment to <a href="mailto:shc-program@northwestern.edu" rel="email">shc-program@northwestern.edu</a>,
