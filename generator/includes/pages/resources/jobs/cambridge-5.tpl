<a id="top"> </a><h1>Post-Doc at Cambridge in Foundations of Physics</h1>
<p>
Applications are invited for a 3 year post doctoral fellowship, funded 
by the John Templeton Foundation, to be held in Department of Applied 
Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), University of Cambridge, 
from 1 July 2012 or as soon as possible thereafter.
</p>
<p>
The post is for research in the foundations of field theories, both 
classical and quantum, and especially their geometric aspects; primarily 
in one or more of these areas: the classical geometric underpinning of 
quantum field theory; topological solitons ; duality transformations.
</p>
<p>
Applicants with foundational interests in quantum field theory that fall 
outside these areas will also be considered. The post will be held in 
the Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations, at DAMTP.
