theory. The salary for a full-time employment agreement increases from 2.042
Euro gross a month in the first year to 2.612 Euro gross a month in the last
year. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the project, the position is
open to candidates with a Master's degree or equivalent in computer science,
economics, logic, or philosophy. Candidates are invited to submit a 3-5 page
