The Department of Logic, History and Philosophy of Science at the 
Universidad Nacional de Educaci&oacute;n a Distancia (Madrid, Spain) wants to 
appoint a junior assistant professor (Profesor ayudante). This is a five 
year contract, with a monthly salary of around 1200 EUR. We seek a 
philosopher of science (AOS: biology, physics)
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Spanish university regulation requires that 
candidates have their degree (BA, PhD) accredited by our Ministry of 
science ("homologacion") at the time of the application. There is no 
time to get it accredited before the application deadline expires (20 
days from now), so I am afraid this opening will only be of interest to 
Spanish graduates working abroad.
