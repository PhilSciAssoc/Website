<p>
The Science in Human Culture Program (SHC) at Northwestern University 
invites applications for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship in the 
contextual study of science, technology, or medicine, to run September 
2013 - August 2015. One Fellow will be selected. Applications are 
welcome from scholars who study science, technology, or medicine from a 
variety of historical, philosophical, sociological, anthropological, or 
literary perspectives. The Fellow will be affiliated with both the SHC 
program and an appropriate disciplinary department (History, Sociology, 
Philosophy, Anthropology, etc.). The Fellow will pursue a program of 
independent scholarship and teach two one-quarter undergraduate courses 
each year: a seminar and a lecture course. He or she will also help 
organize and run the SHC visiting lecturer series. Applicants with a Ph.D. 
must have completed it within the past five years. Applicants without a 
Ph.D. must complete all the requirements for the Ph.D. before September 
1, 2013. At time of application, the applicant must be available for the 
full two-year term. The annual stipend is $48,000, plus $3,500 per year 
to fund research and conference travel. In order to ensure full 
consideration, application materials must be received by January 15, 
2013.  Northwestern encourages applications from women and minority 
groups, AA/EOE.
