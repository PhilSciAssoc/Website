<p>
The Department of History and Philosophy of Science is pleased to offer a one 
or two term Mellon Post Doctoral Fellowship in the period August 30, 2012 - 
April 30, 2013. The Fellowship is to support a scholar with a clearly defined 
monograph project in some area of the history of science or history and 
philosophy of science. The successful candidate would, in addition to pursuing 
his or her research goals, be expected to teach one course each term centered 
on that research, and would grant the University of Pittsburgh Press the first 
option to publish the monograph. Senior scholars should apply for a single 
semester; junior scholars may apply for two semesters. The fellowship is in the 
amount of $40,000, and comes with a full package of benefits.

<p>
This Fellowship is funded as part of a grant from the Mellon Foundation to support 
the development of publishing in the History and Philosophy of Science through 
University of Pittsburgh Press and interactions between the World History Center 
and the Department of History and Philosophy of Science. Special consideration will 
be given to applications that are consonant with the goals of those projects.
