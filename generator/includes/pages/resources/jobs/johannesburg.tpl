<p>
The University of Johannesburg seeks to appoint a Postdoctoral Research 
Fellow in Philosophy. Any research area will be considered, but it is 
hoped that the Fellow will work with Dr Alex Broadbent on issues in the 
philosophy of science broadly construed, and in particular issues 
related to epidemiology, population health, causation, explanation or 
prediction (although unconceived alternatives will be considered). The 
Fellow will be asked to teach one Honours course for one term, out of 
four in our academic calendar. (This is a light commitment: Honours is a 
small group (5-10) course for first year postgraduates, whose content 
usually reflects the interests of the person teaching it.) Applicants 
should email two pieces of written work of around 8-10k words (e.g. 
publications, work under review, thesis chapters) along with a CV and 
covering letter to Dr Alex Broadbent at <a href="mailto:abbroadbent@uj.ac.za" rel="email">abbroadbent@uj.ac.za</a>
by 30 June 2012. Doctorate must be in hand at time of commencement. 
Duration is one year initially with the possibility of renewal depending 
on publications.
