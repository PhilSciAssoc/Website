<p>
The Carnegie Mellon University Department of Philosophy invites 
applications for the Herbert Simon Fellowship in Scientific Philosophy. 
We are seeking applications from scholars working in logic or philosophy 
of mathematics (including its history). Applications in the following 
areas of logic are particularly welcome: proof theory, category theory, 
categorical logic, formal verification, and automated proof search. The 
Fellowship is intended primarily for those who have recently received 
doctorates, including scholars with a continuing faculty appointment 
elsewhere. The Fellowship has a tenure of two years (non-renewable), 
with teaching duties of 2 courses/year, one of which should be a 
research seminar in the Fellow's specialty. Appointments of one year are 
possible for applicants with a continuing faculty appointment elsewhere. 
Residence in Pittsburgh is expected. Applications (including a statement 
of purpose, CV, at least one writing sample and two letters of reference) 
may be sent to:
