<a id="top"> </a><h1>One-Year Appointment, San Francisco State University</h1>
<p>
In the Philosophy Dept at SFSU we have an unusual opportunity at the 
moment to have special one-year appointments, with preference for 
specialty in philosophy of science. We are mainly thinking about a 
post-doc who would be appointed to a one-year non-renewable visiting 
position, although it is possible that we would choose to fill the 
position with an ABD or to arrange for the appointment of a senior 
scholar.  There is also opportunity to participate in an NSF funded 
project on modeling, experiment, and representation 
(<a href="http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1026183" rel="external">http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1026183</a>), 
including a Workshop to be held in Fall 2011. Salary and teaching to be 
negotiated, commensurate with qualifications; SFSU has generous health 
and other benefit plans.
