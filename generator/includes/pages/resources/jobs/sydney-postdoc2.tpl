The University of Sydney has received a prestigious grant from the John 
Templeton Foundation to explore the nature of time and streamline 
worldwide academic research on the subject.
</p>
<p>
The project, entitled <em>New Agendas for the Study of Time: Connecting 
the Disciplines</em>, will focus on asking which aspects of time belong 
to which disciplines in order to reinvigorate, and perhaps resolve, 
age-old puzzles. In achieving this, a new clarity will be brought to the 
study of time in a global sense, setting the agenda for the subject's 
future.
</p>
<p>
As part of the project the University will be making four appointments, 
each in different disciplinary areas.
This particular Postdoctoral Research Fellow (PRF) will work on the 
history and philosophy of time, focussing on the way time is understood

    disciplines, with a view to finding commonalities and differences</li>
<li>publish in journals of high standing, and possibly contribute to 
    chapters in books related to the project</li>
<li>take an interdisciplinary perspective on your research, which in 
    part will involve continued communication between this role and the 
    other three PRF appointments (which will deal with the philosophy of 
    the physics of time; the psychology and neurobiology of time and the 
    metaphysics of time respectively) as well as participation in two of 
    the three international meetings.</li>
<li>contribute to a public discussion on the nature of time</li>
