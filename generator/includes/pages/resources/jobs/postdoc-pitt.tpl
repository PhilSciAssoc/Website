two term Mellon Post Doctoral Fellowship in the period August 30, 2010-April 30, 2011. Â 
The Fellowship is to support a scholar with a clearly defined monograph project
in some area of the history of science or history and philosophy of science.
The successful candidate would, in addition to pursuing his or her research
goals, be expected to teach one course each term centered on that research, and
would grant the University of Pittsburgh Press the first option to publish the
monograph. Senior scholars should apply for a single semester; junior scholars
may apply for two semesters.  The fellowship is in the amount of $40,000, and
comes with a full package of benefits.
