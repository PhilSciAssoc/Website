The  Chair of Philosophy of Science (Professor Stephan Hartmann) at the 
Faculty of Philosophy, Philosophy of Science and Study of Religion and 
the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (MCMP) at 
Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (LMU) seek applications for the 
following positions:
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#asst_profs">Three Assistant Professorships</a></li>
<li><a href="#postdocs">Six Postdoctoral Fellowships</a></li> 
</ol>
<p>
Deadline: July 18, 2012<br />
Starting date: October 1, 2012 (or later)
</p>
<p>
The Chair of Philosophy of Science focuses on general philosophy of 
science and the philosophy of the natural and social sciences. We are 
especially interested in conducting joint research projects with 
colleagues from other faculties at LMU and elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>
The MCMP is devoted to applications of logical, mathematical, and 
computational methods in philosophy. It was established in 2010 and is 
generously supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation through 
two Alexander von Humboldt professorships. Directed by Professor Stephan 
Hartmann and  Professor Hannes Leitgeb, who founded the MCMP, the MCMP 
hosts a vibrant research community of university faculty, postdoctoral 
fellows, doctoral fellows, master students, and visiting fellows. The 
MCMP organizes at least two weekly colloquia and a weekly internal work 
in-progress seminar, as well as various other activities such as 
workshops, conferences, and reading groups. For more information, see
<a href="http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html" rel="external">http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html</a>
The official language at the Chair and at the MCMP is English and 
fluency in German is not mandatory.
</p>
<p>
We especially encourage female scholars to apply. The LMU in general, 
and the Chair of Philosophy of Science and the MCMP in particular, 
endeavor to raise the percentage of women among its academic personnel. 
Furthermore, given equal qualification, severely physically challenged 
individuals will be preferred.

<a id="postdocs"> </a><h3>2. Six Postdoctoral Fellowships</h3> 
<p>
The successful candidates will partake in all of MCMP's academic 
activities and enjoy its administrative facilities and financial support. 
In this round of advertisements, we are especially interested in 
candidates who work in the following areas: general philosophy of 
science (formal and non-formal), philosophy of physics, philosophy of 
psychology, philosophy of social science, philosophy of economics, 
formal epistemology, social epistemology (formal and non-formal), 
individual and collective decision theory, modeling and simulation in 
philosophy, and experimental philosophy, but we are also open to 
candidates who apply formal methods in metaphysics, moral and political 
philosophy or any other part of philosophy.
</p>
<p>
The fellowships are open for candidates with a PhD in philosophy as well 
as for candidates with a PhD in a natural or social science who have 
foundational and/or methodological research interests (please explain in 
the letter). The postdoctoral stipends are for three years, and they 
should be taken up by October 1, 2012, but a later starting date is also 
possible. (Please let us know if you wish to start at a later date.) 
Each stipend will amount to EUR 2400 of monthly salary (normally 
tax-free, but excluding insurance). Additionally, the MCMP helps its 
fellows with the costs that arise from attending conferences (fees, 
traveling, accommodation). There is the possibility, though no 
obligation, to do some teaching in either English or German.
