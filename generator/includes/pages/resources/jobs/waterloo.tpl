The University of Waterloo invites applications for the inaugural Wolfe Chair in
Scientific and Technological Literacy.  This newly endowed chair in the
Department of Philosophy, secured through a national competition, is designed to

scholar with a record of highly-regarded research and teaching in a relevant
field, including Philosophy of Science, Public Understanding of Science, History
of Science, or Science, Technology and Society.
