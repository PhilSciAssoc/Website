AOS:  Empirically-informed Philosophy of Mind. AOC: Open, but some
preference for Metaphysics, Epistemology, Philosophy of Science, or
Philosophy of Cognitive Science. Ph.D. required by appointment date.
Salary commensurate with qualifications.  Tenure-track faculty

Philosophy's Provost-approved Action Plan calls for reinforcing a
departmental strength in interdisciplinary philosophy of mind.  Four
philosophers currently support the Neurophilosophy Track of the
Department's M.A. program and are also members of the University's
newly formed Neuroscience Institute, <a href="http://www.neuroscience.gsu.edu" rel="external">http://www.neuroscience.gsu.edu</a>.  
The Neuroscience Institute brings together over seventy faculty from
twelve departments to conduct interdisciplinary research.   The
Department of Philosophy is also home to the Jean Beer Blumenfeld
Center for Ethics, <a href="http://www.gsu.edu/ethics" rel="external">http://www.gsu.edu/ethics</a>.
