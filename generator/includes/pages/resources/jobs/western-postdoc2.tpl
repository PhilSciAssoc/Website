<a id="top"> </a><h1>Two Postdoctoral Fellows in Philosophy and Science, Western University</h1>
<p>
The Rotman Institute of Philosophy at The Western University in London, 
Ontario, Canada invites applicants for two separate Postdoctoral 
Fellowships in Philosophy and Science. Each fellowship is offered for 
one year with a possibility of renewal for a second year. The 
fellowships provide an opportunity for new scholars to pursue their 
chosen areas of scholarly research further in a research-intensive 
environment. For one fellowship, we seek a scholar working on general 
issues in philosophy of science, such as the status of laws, causation, 
and symmetries, in light of contemporary physics. For the second, we 
seek a scholar whose philosophical project engages the sciences, broadly 
construed -- including philosophical research related to specific 
sciences, or research regarding the ethical and political dimensions of 
science. Deadline to apply: Feb 15, 2013. Full Details:
