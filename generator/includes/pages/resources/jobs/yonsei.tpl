The Underwood International College of Yonsei University invites 
applications for a tenure-track position as Assistant Professor of 
Philosophy to teach at the Sinchon Campus in Seoul. Those who specialize 
in philosophy of science are especially encouraged to apply. Historians 
of science with interest and competency in philosophy of science will 
also be considered. Candidates should have strong research credentials 
and a firm commitment to undergraduate liberal arts education. Teaching 
responsibilities are 6 credit-hours (2 classes) per semester. The 
preferred starting date is September 2013. Compensation includes 
competitive salary, health insurance and other benefits, fully-subsidized 
housing (for up to 6 years), and a generous relocation and start-up 
package. Yonsei University's Underwood International College is a highly 
competitive program at South Korea's most prestigious private university, 
and combines the intimate atmosphere and low student-faculty ratio of a 
liberal arts college with the resources of a major research university. 
All instruction is in English, and the student body represents over 40 
different countries. As part of Yonsei Universityâ€™s continuing effort to 
increase faculty diversity, we are only accepting applications from 
non-Korean citizens. Interested applicants should send a short letter of
