<a id="top"> </a><h1>Visiting Fellows Program, Rotman Institute, University of Western Ontario</h1>
<p>
The Rotman Institute of Philosophy invites applications to its Visiting 
Fellows Program for 2013. The program offers scholars the opportunity to 
spend one semester as part of an active, diverse and welcoming 
intellectual community working at the intersection of philosophy and the 
sciences.
</p>
<p>
Applications are welcome from scholars holding doctoral degrees who are 
pursuing research projects that engage contemporary science from the 
perspectives of ethics, epistemology, history or policy.
</p>
<p>
Visiting Fellows have no formal duties beyond an active participation in 
the intellectual life of the Rotman Institute. They are encouraged to 
participate in the many reading groups, seminars, talks, workshops and 
other ongoing projects at the Rotman Institute, and to give talks 
introducing their own research projects to the Institute.  They are 
invited as well to take advantage of the broader activities of the 
Department of Philosophy including colloquia, conferences, and graduate 
seminars (with instructor permission). Western University's Department 
of Philosophy is one of the most distinguished in Canada.
</p>
<p>
Each Visiting Fellow is provided with an office in the Rotman Institute 
of Philosophy equipped with a desktop computer; modest office and IT 
support; and full access to the library facilities and services of 
Western University. Visiting Fellows must reside in London, Ontario for 
the duration of their term, and they receive a supplementary stipend of 
$1,300 per month to help defray the cost of relocation. Note that 
purchase of the University Health Insurance Plan is mandatory, and 
depending on family size, can range close to $1000.
</p>
