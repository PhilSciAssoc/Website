diversity of origins and backgrounds, many of whom find their way into 
the philosophy program. The department is therefore looking for a 
philosopher with broad interests and who is passionate about teaching in 
a liberal arts setting. Mount Allison University welcomes diversity in 
the workplace and encourages applications from all qualified men and
