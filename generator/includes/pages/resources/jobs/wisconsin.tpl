The Robert F. and Jean E. Holtz Center for Science &amp; Technology Studies 
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is pleased to solicit applications 
for a two-year postdoctoral fellow beginning in the 2012-13 academic
year. Funded by a generous bequest from the Holtz Family Fund, the 
Center supports a variety of activities designed to promote innovative 
interdisciplinary research, education, and public outreach in humanistic 
and social studies of science, technology, biomedicine, engineering and 
the environment. As such, we seek applicants whose research relates 
broadly to science and technology studies, but who might come from one 
of a number of scholarly backgrounds, including (but not limited to) 
Anthropology, Bioethics, Education, Engineering, Environmental Studies, 
Gender Studies, Geography, Journalism &amp; Mass Communications, History, 
Human Ecology, Law, Library and Information Studies, Medicine, 
Philosophy, Public Health, or Sociology. In addition to conducting 
research, the fellow will teach one undergraduate course in the first 
academic year and help organize a workshop in the second academic year. 
Applicants must be scholars who are not yet tenured and must have earned 
a Ph.D. no earlier than August 2005 and no later than August 30, 2012. 
The successful applicant must have completed all requirements for the 
Ph.D., including the filing of the thesis, before the first day of the 
appointment. The fellow is expected to participate in the life of the 
Science &amp; Technology Studies community by attending Holtz Center events. 
Full-time residency in Madison is normally required for the duration of 
the appointment, although some flexibility in the residency requirement 
is possible if arranged in advance. The salary for the position is 
$40,000 for the first nine-month academic year plus some modest start-up 
funds, and $42,000 for the second nine-month academic year. The 
appointment includes health and other benefits. Applicants should submit 
a current cv, a research proposal of no more than 3 single-spaced pages 
summarizing the research to be conducted during the period of the 
appointment and its relationship to science and technology studies 
(finalists will be asked to submit a longer proposal), a course proposal 
for an undergraduate science and technology studies class that the 
applicant would be interested in teaching, a sample of written work such 
as a paper or dissertation chapter, and three letters of recommendation 
via email to Lyn Macgregor, Assistant Director of the Holtz Center for 
Science &amp; Technology Studies at <a href="mailto:lmacgreg@ssc.wisc.edu" rel="email">lmacgreg@ssc.wisc.edu</a>. 
Applications must be received by February 1, 2012 to be guaranteed full 
consideration. A criminal background check will be conducted prior to 
hiring. Applicants are encouraged to learn more about the Holtz Center 
and our current faculty affiliates at <a href="http://www.sts.wisc.edu/index.html" rel="external">http://www.sts.wisc.edu/index.html</a>.
