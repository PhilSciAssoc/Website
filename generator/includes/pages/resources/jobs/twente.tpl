The Department of Philosophy of the University of Twente (the Netherlands) is looking for two Assistant Professors   (full-time, tenure-track):
</p>
<h2>Applied Ethics and/or Political Philosophy with a (future) emphasis on technology</h2>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>
You teach ethics and political philosophy in the master program in 
Philosophy of Science, Technology and Society (PSTS) and teach 
professional and applied ethics and other areas of philosophy for 
bachelor and master programs in engineering and social science. 
Optionally, you may participate in the new ATLAS university college, an 
interdisciplinary, highly selective bachelor program with a focus on 
engineering and social science. You are involved in the supervision of
master's theses in the PSTS program and will at some point supervise 
PhD students in the department's PhD program in Ethics and Technology 
(the scope of which also includes social and political philosophy).
</p>
<p>

following areas: environmental philosophy and technology (especially 
energy); safety, security, and technological risks; technology and 
politics; technology and well-being; technology, culture, globalization 
and ethics/politics; ethics and engineering science / engineering design. 
However, other (future) specializations will be seriously considered as 
well. Your research will be embedded in the department's research 
program as well as in the 3TU.Center of Excellence for Ethics and 
Technology (<a href="http://www.ethicsandtechnology.eu" rel="external">http://www.ethicsandtechnology.eu</a>),
