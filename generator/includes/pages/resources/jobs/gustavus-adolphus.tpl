Gustavus Adolphus College invites applications for a tenure-track 
Assistant Professor position specializing in the Philosophy of Science 
beginning September 1, 2012. We have some preference for the philosophy 
of biology, but we are open to all areas. AOC should include formal 
logic. The willingness to teach environmental philosophy at some point 
in the future is helpful. The successful candidate should be able to 
demonstrate excellence in teaching. We seek candidates who have earned 
doctorate, but will consider candidates who have achieve ABD. The 
department seeks candidates who can play an active role in connecting 
the sciences with the liberal arts at a college-wide level. Regular 
participation in the college's signature event, the annual Nobel 
Conference (<a href="http://www.gustavus.edu/events/nobelconference/2011" rel="external">http://www.gustavus.edu/events/nobelconference/2011</a>) 
is strongly desired. We also encourage support for the college's 
integrated general education program, Curriculum II, whose science 
course offers, "an historical view of the evolution of human 
understanding of the physical universe." (<a href="http://www.gustavus.edu/curricII" rel="external">http://www.gustavus.edu/curricII</a>) 
Primary responsibilities will include six courses/year, and regular 
contribution to general education. A commitment to teaching and advising 
is essential. Application information is located at:

Review of applications will begin on November 15, 2011, and continue 
until the position is filled. We will interview at the Eastern Division 
Meeting of the American Philosophical Association. Candidates chosen for 
an interview will be informed by the middle of December. Gustavus 
Adolphus College is a coeducational, private, Lutheran (ELCA), 
residential, national liberal arts college of 2500 students. It is the
