<strong>Applications are sought for a two-year postdoctoral research 
fellowship linked to a new project on the relationship between genetics 
teaching and genetic determinism.  The application deadline is Thursday 
9 August 2012.  Interviews of shortlisted candidates will take place the 
following Thursday, with the successful candidate beginning on 1 
September 2012.</strong>

FURTHER DETAILS

<p> 
For more than a century, the teaching of genetics has been organized 
around concepts originating with Gregor Mendel.  But, in the genomics 
age, is Mendelian pedagogy still fit for purpose?  What are the 
alternatives?  And what sorts of attitudes and aptitudes do different 
kinds of pedagogies promote in students of the science of inheritance?  
These questions form the basis of a new two-year interdisciplinary 
research project at the University of Leeds between Prof. Gregory Radick 
(HPS) and Dr. Jenny Lewis (Education).   Applications are now sought for 
a Postdoctoral Research Fellow who will be centrally involved in all 
aspects of the project, including the design, delivery and evaluation of 
a non-Mendelian genetics curriculum.
</p>
<p> 
On the HPS side, the project arises from Prof. Radick's research into 
the debates surrounding the emergence of Mendelian genetics in the early 
years of the twentieth century, in particular the views of the most 
profound biological critic of the new "Mendelism", W. F. R. Weldon 
(1860-1906), and the possibility that, had Weldon lived, the science of 
heredity might have developed differently, with far more emphasis on the 
environmental conditioning of hereditary effects (a pervasive theme for 
Weldon) than was actually the case.  On the science education side, the 
project intersects with Dr. Lewis' longstanding interest in incorporating 
the perspectives of genomics into the genetics curriculum in schools, 
and her concern (widely shared) that the traditional stress on 
unrepresentative single-gene disorders might promote genetic determinism 
and so undermine efforts elsewhere in the curriculum to deny or combat 
the view that genes are somehow "super" causes.

Generous funding from the Faraday Institute, in connection with its Uses 
and Abuses of Biology grants programme, will enable the project to cover 
costs for several research trips by the Fellow, for the Fellow's 
participation in two international conferences, and for the hosting at 
Leeds of a mid-project workshop and an end-of-project international 
conference, both to be organized by the Fellow.  At Leeds, the Fellow 
will be primarily associated with the Centre for History and Philosophy 
of Science, but also with the Centre for Studies of Science and 
Mathematics Education, the Centre for Medical Humanities, and the 
University of Leeds Biology Education Research Group.
