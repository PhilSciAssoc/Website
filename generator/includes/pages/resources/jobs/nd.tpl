<a id="top"> </a><h1>Postdoctoral Fellowship in Ethics Education in Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame</h1>
<p>
The Reilly Center for Science, Technology, and Values at the University of Notre Dame 
seeks to appoint a Postdoctoral Fellow for three years beginning July 1, 2014. 
Applicants must have completed all requirements for the doctoral degree by summer 2014.
Applications are welcome from scholars working in any area of the ethics of science and 
engineering, with preference given to applicants with a strong educational background in 
a field of science or engineering.
</p>
<p>
The Reilly Center is home to the History and Philosophy of Science (HPS) graduate program 
and an undergraduate minor in Science, Technology, and Values (STV). For further 
information about the Reilly Center and its educational programs please visit <a href="http://reilly.nd.edu/" rel="external">http://reilly.nd.edu/</a>.
</p>
<p>
The post-doctoral fellow will contribute to a National Science Foundation (NSF) Ethics 
Education in Science and Engineering (EESE) project (award 1338652), teach courses in 
the HPS and STV programs, and perform original research, in roughly the following manner:
</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>30% to the NSF-EESE project: The postdoctoral fellow has direct responsibility for the 
	final design, implementation, coordination, and supervision of the project, including 
	recruitment of graduate students for the program, developing the program's educational 
	content, and overseeing the students in the program. An understanding of virtue ethics 
	is desired.</li>

<li>25% to teaching courses: The courses taught will directly relate to the specific needs 
	of the EESE program's graduate students. The load is two courses per year (one per 
	semester), on topics concerning the ethics and/or policy of science and technology. It 
	is expected that each course will be new to either the HPS graduate program or STV 
	undergraduate minor program and will be taught on a yearly basis.</li>

<li>45% to research: The postdoctoral fellow will continue his/her ongoing research program, 
	which should primarily engage issues in the ethics of science and technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The annual stipend is $40,000. The fellowship package also includes health insurance and 
$6,000 over three years towards research expenses and conference travel.
