		<span class="bold">New Graduate Program in Science and Technology Studies at York University</span>
		<p>
			York University is pleased to announce a new Graduate Program in Science and Technology Studies.
			The Program, currently under review by the province, is still pending approval.
			We anticipate that it will be approved in time for us to launch the program next academic year (2009-2010).
			We are now inviting applications to the Program, with a deadline of February 15, 2009.
			The Graduate Program in Science and Technology Studies offers advanced training leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees.
			Drawing upon the demonstrated expertise of a wide range of faculty members within York University's undergraduate Science and Technology Studies program, and related areas of study at York, the graduate program aims to provide highly qualified students with a unique opportunity of doing specialized academic work focusing on the critical role of science and technology, both past and present.
			Research in the field applies the methods and theories of the social sciences and cultural studies to the examination of technology and scientific knowledge and practice.
			The program's mandate is to produce graduates equipped to utilize the rich tools afforded by interdisciplinary scholarship in science and technology studies, with an emphasis on four fields: Biosciences and Biotechnologies; Human-Machine Interactions; Public Science; Physical Systems.
			Application information is available <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/gradsts/howtoapply.html" rel="external">here</a>.
			For more information see the Graduate Science and Technology Studies Program <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/gradsts/" rel="external">website</a> or contact <a href="mailto:lightman@yorku.ca" rel="email">Professor Bernard Lightman</a> (416-736-2100 ext. 22028).

<a id="guide"> </a><h2>Guide to Graduate Study</h2>  
<p>
Advanced training in philosophy of science has been around as long as 
there have been graduate programs in philosophy.  Given, moreover, that 
throughout its career, philosophy of science has advanced in 
conversation with both the sciences and with other disciplines that have 
taken science as their topic of intellectual curiosity (history of 
science, sociology of science, etc.), programs specializing in 
philosophy of science have taken various forms and have different foci.  
Most important for those considering graduate work in philosophy of 
science is the fact that some programs with strength in philosophy of 
science are philosophy departments whereas others are specialized 
programs or departments in history and philosophy of science, science 
and technology studies, or similar interdisciplinary pursuits.  In 
addition, there is a variety of intellectual traditions within which one 
can pursue philosophy of science and recently there has been a 
reinstitution or reinvigoration of philosophy of science graduate 
programs in Europe.
</p>  
<p>
There are many guides to choosing graduate programs in philosophy 
available online and a number of sources of advice for prospective 
graduate students about how to decide what programs to apply to and/or 
attend if admitted.  There are also many rankings of graduate programs, 
including subject-specific lists of programs with particular strength in 
the philosophy of science, as well as in the philosophy of particular 
sciences, mathematics, etc.  We recommend drawing information from a 
variety of sources, including others besides this guide.  But below we 
provide some advice and suggestions of our own, including many intended 
specifically for those considering work in the philosophy of science, in 
the hope that this will be useful to prospective graduate students in 
deciding which graduate programs to apply to, what program to attend, 
and how to get the most out of campus visits.
</p>  
<h3>General Advice</h3>  
<p>
Perhaps the most general issue an applicant must decide upon is whether 
to undertake PhD- or Masters-level training.  There are relatively few 
dedicated masters programs in philosophy in the USA but there are such 
programs in Britain, the Commonwealth countries, and throughout Europe.  
The existence of such programs means that PhD study in those countries 
often proceeds from the expectation that in-coming PhD students will 
have a masters degree.  (For example, Canadian PhD programs often 
require fewer courses than US PhD programs do.)  Since the specific 
questions a potential applicant must bear in mind are, however, quite 
similar for both masters- and PhD-level study, this guide does not 
separate out the two levels for separate consideration.
</p>  
<p>
Keep in mind that the overall strength of a given graduate program may 
ultimately matter less to the quality of your graduate experience than 
whether the program is strong in the particular area(s) of philosophy or 
philosophy of science in which you have a specific interest. In deciding 
whether to apply to a given program, start by visiting the program's 
webpage and reading the descriptions given by individual faculty members 
of their interests and recent work.  You should also look for recent 
courses taught by various faculty members, titles and/or descriptions of 
the dissertations of current and recent graduates of the program, and 
other useful information that will help give you some sense of what that 
department is like and what sort of work most regularly goes on within 
it.    
</p>  
<p>
In addition, virtually all graduate programs in philosophy encourage 
students to visit before deciding what program to attend, and we 
strongly recommend that you do so if possible.  These days many top 
programs host group visits of admitted prospective graduate students, 
and there are sometimes even funds available to help cover some of the 
travel costs for such visits.  Much of importance about the intellectual 
culture of a program and the experiences of its graduate students can 
only be gleaned from actually visiting that program in person and 
talking to current graduate students as well as members of the faculty.  
While visiting, try to envision yourself in working relationships with 
members of the faculty who conduct research and advise students in the 
area(s) of greatest interest to you.  Also try to talk to as many 
different graduate students as possible, and keep in mind that any one 
person's experiences will be idiosyncratic. Make sure, however, that you 
talk extensively with graduate students who work in the philosophy of 
science -- ideally those in any specific subfields in which you have a 
particular interest -- because their experiences will often be a better 
guide to what yours might be like than those of other students. Find out 
how many students are in the area(s) that interest you most -- in 
graduate school you will often learn as much from your fellow students 
as you do from the faculty—and find out how many faculty are in that 
area or those areas.  If there aren't any existing students in the 
philosophy of science or in the particular subfield that interests you, 
find out why not.
</p>  
<p>  
What follows below is a list of questions and issues that many 
successful graduates of top programs in the philosophy of science have 
told us they were either glad they looked into or came to wish they had.  
We hope this list will be useful whether you are exploring a program's 
website, visiting it in person, or investigating it in some other way.  
Many of the issues raised below are ones that would be important to 
investigate for any graduate program in philosophy, while others are 
specific to graduate study in the philosophy of science.  Although these 
questions are organized by subject matter, there is some overlap between 
them, and note that some are more appropriately addressed to faculty 
members while others would be more appropriate for current graduate 
students in a program.  We do not by any means wish to suggest that this 
collection is exhaustive, and if there is a question or issue you think 
should be added to the list below, please email your suggestion to the 
Governing Board via the executive secretary, Gary Hardcastle at 
<a href="mailto:ghardcas@bloomu.edu" rel="email">ghardcas@bloomu.edu</a>.
</p>  

<h3>A Note Concerning Placement</h3>  
<p>
One of the most rewarding things about graduate education and/or 
academic employment in philosophy is the chance to join an intellectual 
community whose members are sincerely engaged with the deepest and most 
fundamental questions they can find.  For this reason among others, 
graduate education and/or employment in philosophy is not simply a job 
like any other or just another part of the rat race—instead, it is a 
mildly incredible fact that some people are lucky enough to be able to 
actually make a living by thinking, reading, writing, and teaching about 
the things that interest them most!  All that said, keep in mind that in 
addition to joining such an intellectual community you are also 
preparing yourself to try to enter a tough, competitive business in 
which there are no guarantees:  most academic jobs involve considerably 
more teaching and less research than those held by faculty at top 
research institutions, and every year it seems that some talented, 
hardworking graduates of good programs wind up without permanent 
academic employment at all. This should not discourage you from pursuing 
graduate education in philosophy if it is something you truly love and 
are prepared to commit to, but you should be aware that probably not 
everyone who does so will ultimately enjoy an academic career. It should 
also encourage you to pay at least some attention to the information 
available regarding the placement record of any graduate program you 
consider attending.  Find out what the department's recent placement 
record is like (including for students who weren't the absolute stars of 
their cohort or year).  To what extent does the department seem to think 
of itself as responsible for placing their students as opposed to 
helping students place themselves?  How much assistance and guidance do 
students get in preparing themselves for the job market?  What services 
does the department provide for graduate students to help them get jobs, 
and for how long can a graduating student expect those services to 
continue, if necessary?  If the department's placement record seems to 
be improving or deteriorating in recent years as compared to previous 
ones, be sure to try to find out why people think this is -- 
investigating may uncover useful information about a program whether or 
not it has anything to do with recent changes in its placement record.  
If you are considering studying abroad but would like to have a serious 
possibility of job placement back in your home country, do investigate 
the department's understanding of and willingness to help with job 
placement back in your country of origin.
</p>  

<h3>Culture of the Department and Intellectual Community</h3>  
<p>
What is the culture of the department like generally—is it collegial, 
competitive, supportive, or something else altogether? Are people around 
the department and/or in their offices a lot of the time?  Are there 
many departmental events or just a few, and what are these like?  Is it 
nerve-racking or enjoyable (or something in between) for students to 
spend time socially with members of the faculty?  Do students routinely 
go out for coffee or a drink with members of the faculty or does 
faculty/student interaction tend to be more formal?  (Note:  There is a 
wide range of levels of formality in departmental culture, ranging from 
department-wide parties, intramural sports teams, and poker games to 
departments in which untenured faculty members are expected to attend 
graduate seminars taught by more senior faculty!)  What is morale like 
generally among students in the program?  How diverse is the department 
-- both faculty and graduate students -- in terms of gender, race, 
ethnicity, country of origin, sexual orientation, disability, etc.? Will 
you feel comfortable in this group?  What is it like to be a female (or 
member of some other easily identifiable group to which you belong) 
graduate student in this program?  Bear in mind that there will most 
likely be significant resources (women's centers, international students' 
centers, etc.) at any university; is the department working with such 
organizations to build a welcoming environment? Find out what convinced 
current students to choose the program and whether anything surprised 
them after they showed up.  Ask people what the worst thing about the 
program is, and in what ways they see the department as most likely to 
be different in five years than it is right now.
</p>  
<p>
Make an effort to find out what members of the faculty are like not 
simply as scholars, but as teachers, advisors, and mentors.  How 
available are members of the faculty generally to students?  How quickly 
can a student who wants to talk to a given faculty member about an 
academic matter generally do so?  Sit in on a meeting of a graduate 
seminar if you can, but keep in mind that it will reflect the teaching 
style of just one person, and this will vary quite a bit between faculty 
members.  How quickly do faculty members read and respond to student 
work, and is their feedback useful?  How much guidance and input can 
students expect from the faculty in trying to pass milestones like 
qualifying exams, papers, or defending a dissertation prospectus?  In 
what ways and how often do faculty members seem to interact with 
students who are writing dissertations under their direction?  (Be aware 
that this too often varies widely between faculty members in a given 
program.)
</p>  
<p>
More generally, do interactions between faculty and graduate students 
tend to be friendly, paternalistic, adversarial, or what?  Do the 
faculty seem to think of themselves more as working with students or as 
instructing them?  Do they seem engaged in a common intellectual 
enterprise with students? To what extent and in what ways do faculty 
members involve students in their own programs of research? Do students 
feel that faculty members are automatically committed to helping them as 
members of the program, or do students feel that they must "earn" the 
attention of members of the faculty by producing work that impresses 
and/or interests them?  Do the faculty genuinely seem to have the 
students' collective best interests at heart?  Does the department 
provide help in areas like language instruction if you are studying in a 
language that is not your native language?
</p>  
<p>
What is the position of philosophy of science like in the department?  
Are there members of the faculty who are hostile to it?  How broad is 
the department's expertise in the philosophy of science?  If a student 
arrives interested in one area of the philosophy of science, but 
discovers that she is really more interested in another (or some other 
part of philosophy altogether), are faculty members' attitudes and 
expertise broad enough to enable her to explore widely and/or change 
areas of study easily?  Find out how interdisciplinary projects or those 
that are hybrid between philosophy and other fields seem to be viewed in 
the department.
</p>  
<p>
Does the program admit students with undergraduate backgrounds in the 
sciences, mathematics, etc., in addition to those with academic 
backgrounds in philosophy?  If so, how many current students arrived 
with such backgrounds?  If you have a similar background, be sure to 
talk to those students.  Find out how strong other departments on campus 
are that might matter to you, like those in particular sciences in which 
you have an interest and/or in other fields that study scientific 
inquiry, like the history of science or the sociology of science.  
Have any current students taken courses from faculty in those 
departments?  Have any members of those departments served on 
dissertation committees for graduate students in the department you are 
considering?  Make an effort to find out how much interest in (or 
patience for!) the philosophy of science is possessed by faculty members 
in any other departments in which you might expect to do a significant 
amount of coursework or whose members might ultimately be a useful 
resource for you at the dissertation-writing stage.
</p>  
<p>
Don't forget to consider intellectual resources not directly on campus.  
Are there other strong departments nearby?  If so, are there patterns of 
regular interaction?  Do students take classes at these other 
institutions, either formally or informally?  Do faculty from these 
other schools ever serve on dissertation committees in the department? 
Are there regular regional conferences or reading groups? Especially in 
some urban areas (e.g. New York, London, Boston, southern California), 
these connections can expand, and enrich, your intellectual community 
significantly.
</p>

<h3>Prospective Advisors and Dissertation Directors</h3>
<p>
Some students are already well aware of which faculty members at a given 
program are those with whom they would be most interested in working.  
If you are not, you may get some ideas from exploring the webpages of 
individual faculty members.  In addition, the department's website may 
include information about which students are currently writing 
dissertations with particular faculty members and on what subjects -- 
this can often be found by checking the online profiles of existing 
graduate students in the program.  If you visit the program in person, 
be sure to meet with any faculty members under whose direction you think 
you might ultimately write a dissertation, but also meet with other 
faculty members in the same or similar areas:  it is quite common for a 
person to choose a graduate program because of interest in the work of 
one faculty member but wind up writing a dissertation with another.  
Given that this is the case, it is good to consider whether there is 
more than one person you could imagine working closely with. 
</p>
<p>
When talking to a prospective dissertation advisor in this way, try to 
get a general read on your compatibility.  Find out what sorts of 
projects that faculty member thinks wind up being the most successful 
dissertations and what sorts of students wind up being the most 
successful in the program.  Try to get an understanding of why she 
thinks (if she does!) that you are an attractive candidate for the 
program.  Find out what she most wants to improve about the program 
(this can be a sensitive subject, so tread carefully and tactfully).  
Ask if she yet knows what the subject of the next graduate seminar she 
teaches will be, and find out what recent graduate seminar she most 
enjoyed teaching.  Do not be afraid to let a particular faculty member 
know that your interest in the program substantially depends upon her 
presence within it and to verify that she does not already have plans to 
relocate elsewhere, or retire, in the near future.  Of course you should 
keep in mind that particular faculty members might themselves be 
genuinely uncertain about their own immediate futures.  In addition to 
direct conversations with faculty members, it can be well worth 
considering someone's track record of mobility.
</p>
<p>
If you do know whom you might hope to have as a primary advisor or 
dissertation committee chair, make an effort to find and talk not only 
to that faculty member but also to her existing students. And if a 
faculty member with whom you are interested in working has no current 
graduate students, find out (politely!) why not -- there are lots of 
perfectly innocent reasons for this, and some less so.  Try to find out 
how much guidance and support individual students can expect to receive 
during the dissertation-writing stage.  Does that particular faculty 
member seem to interact regularly with students who are writing 
dissertations under her direction, or does she instead send students off 
to write dissertations more-or-less on their own?  (Be aware that 
students' individual styles of philosophical inquiry vary, too, so talk 
to more than one person about any or all of these matters if possible.)   
</p>

<h3>Coursework and Instruction</h3>
<p>
Are required courses taught frequently enough to make deadlines for 
satisfying course distribution requirements realistic? Are such 
requirements appropriate to the needs of students working in the 
philosophy of science?  Are there further program requirements (like 
comprehensive exams or other conditions that must be satisfied before 
advancing to work on a dissertation) and are these structured in a way 
that is helpful and useful for students in the philosophy of science?  
Do any faculty in the program have strong relationships with those in 
science departments, particularly those in which you have a special 
interest?  Also find out how supportive the department is of students 
taking courses outside the department itself and/or their primary field 
of graduate study.  Is it easy to take courses in science departments or 
others besides the one to which you have been admitted?  Has this 
actually been done in the area of your particular interest (and how 
recently)?  There is considerable variation in this respect:  some 
departments have strict limits on the number of graduate courses taken 
outside the department that will count towards a student's degree 
progress, while others strongly encourage students to take relevant 
courses outside of philosophy (especially in the sciences themselves) 
and will, for example, even make provisions for students to take 
additional time in the program to complete an MA in a related field.
</p>

<h3>Program Completion, Funding, Teaching, Housing, and other Practical Matters</h3>
<p>
How long does it take most students to complete the program?  What 
percentage of those who start the program complete it, and why do those 
who drop out do so?  What is the level of available financial support 
like generally?  For how long can students expect to be funded and in 
what ways? How does the typical funding package, or the specific one you 
have been offered, compare with the typical time to complete the 
program? Currently (2012), funding packages for philosophy PhD programs 
in the United States typically provide 4-6 years of guaranteed support 
for students making good progress.  Funding in other countries varies 
considerably and can take forms quite different from the US norm.  Some 
packages include summer funding and other perks.  Most require some 
teaching, though how much varies widely.  Be aware that students who 
teach most terms during graduate school will likely require more time to 
complete their programs than students with significant funded time 
without teaching obligations.  As you compare programs, the number of 
years of support you can expect (and the form this support will take) is 
an important factor, but intellectual excellence and fit are obviously 
the most crucial considerations. Is there competition for funding among 
graduate students, and if so, how does this affect the culture of the 
department?  Is there support available for graduate students to attend 
conferences and other academic travel? (Conferences can be especially 
important for those considering programs with few or no other students 
in philosophy of science.)  Are there many conferences nearby?  Are 
there funds available from national granting competitions and, if so, 
are those funds tied to citizenship or residency requirements?  You 
should be wary of taking on considerable debt in order to finance 
graduate school for the simple reason that your salary afterwards, 
unlike those of your friends in law and medicine, will not be 
sufficiently large to pay off debt easily.
</p>
<p>
How much teaching do graduate students do, and how enjoyable and/or 
intellectually productive is that teaching?  Are graduate students able 
to teach courses of their own at some point in the program, and, if so, 
how often does this actually happen?  Are most Teaching Assistant (or 
equivalent) assignments in courses that are taught by faculty in the 
department?  How often are students able to serve as Teaching Assistants 
for courses in their own areas of interest and/or specialization? 
</p>
<p>
What do most people do for housing?  Will the university help find 
housing, and does the housing office seem like it’s on the side of 
students?  What sort of transportation is needed?  Are there teaching or 
other employment opportunities outside the university?  Does the 
department offer summer support?  What do most graduate students do over 
the summer months?  More generally, your life over the next several 
years is not just within the department but in the city or town in which 
the department is located.  Students who are miserable, terrified, bored 
to death, unable to communicate effectively with the locals, and so on, 
do not generally do very well in graduate school.  Without being overly 
precious, do give some thought to your compatibility with the places you 
are considering living.  If there are social, cultural, athletic, or 
artistic activities that are important to you, find out what is 
available.  What do graduate students do with their free time? What 
neighborhoods do they live in, and what neighborhoods do they wish they 
lived in?  Are there significant safety issues around the campus or the 
city?  Now is the time to ask.
</p>

<h3>A Final Thought</h3>
<p>
Finally, be sure to ask each graduate student you talk to what else she 
wishes she had asked someone when she was in your position!
