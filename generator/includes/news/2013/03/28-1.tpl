The Officers of the PSA welcome and congratulate Professor Waters on his 
election to the Presidency of the PSA, and welcome and congratulate 
Professors Ankeny and Richardson on their election to the PSA Governing 
Board! The Officers also offer deep appreciation and thanks to Nancy 
Cartwright, former PSA President (University of California, 
San Diego/University of Durham), and Robert Batterman (University of 
Pittsburgh) for their service to the PSA. The Officers of the PSA also 
thank the Nominating Committee, comprised of Hanne Andersen (Aarhus 
University), Kathleen Okruhlik (University of Western Ontario), and, as 
chair, P. Kyle Stanford (University of California, Irvine) for 
assembling a stellar ballot.

<p>
The 2012 PSA Election was conducted electronically by the History of 
Science Society, under the supervision of Jay Malone. PSA members were 
solicited to vote via email. Of 534 Full PSA members eligible to vote in 
the 2012 PSA election, 194 (36.23%) cast votes. The absolute number of 
voters in the 2012 election increased 16.87% over the absolute number of 
voters in the 2011 election, and turnout in 2012 rose 7.46 percentage 
points as compared to 2011.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I thank those Full PSA members who took the time to vote in 
this election. Once again, the PSA Election ran smoothly due in large 
part to the experience and dedication of Jay Malone and his staff at the 
History of Science Society, especially Greg Macklem. If you are a Full
Member of the PSA and you encountered problems in voting electronically, 
though, or if you have any other comments, questions, or concerns about 
the 2012 PSA Election, please contact me at <a href="mailto:psa@umbc.edu" rel="email">psa@umbc.edu</a>.

<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Jessica Pfeifer<br />
Executive Secretary and Treasurer
