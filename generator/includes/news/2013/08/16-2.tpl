Symposia should involve several presenters, typically 4-5, organized around a topic of 
interest. A selection of symposia will be accepted for presentation at the PSA 2014 meeting. 
Symposium presenters may submit their papers, after the conference, for review for publication 
in a supplementary issue of <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>. The evaluation for publication will be of 
individual papers. Symposium papers may be posted as a PSA 2014 Conference Paper at 
<a href="http://philsciarchive.pitt.edu">http://philsciarchive.pitt.edu</a> (a publicly accessible digital archive) prior to the meeting.  All symposium papers submitted for review after the meeting may be electronically archived, whether or not 
they are accepted for publication. The submission deadline for symposium papers will be 
announced at a later date.

<p>
The Committee aims to prepare a program that reflects the full range of current work in the 
philosophy of science. Symposia that make connections with, or include, working scientists, as 
well as symposia of potential interest to members of both the Philosophy of Science Association 
and the History of Science Society are warmly invited. We will not be considering 'Author 
Meets Critics' sessions (but topical sessions that build upon recently published books are 
acceptable).
