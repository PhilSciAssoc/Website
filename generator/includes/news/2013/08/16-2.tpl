%%%
<p>
Submission is now open for proposals for symposia to be presented at the PSA 2014 meeting 
in Chicago, IL on November 6-9, 2014. Symposia may be on any topic in the philosophy of 
science. The PSA 2014 Program Committee will strive for quality, variety, innovation and 
diversity on the program. Members of the PSA 2014 Program Committee are listed at 
<a href="http://www.philsci.org/meetings/psa2014/index.html">http://www.philsci.org/meetings/psa2014/index.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The deadline for Symposium proposals is <strong>January 6, 2014</strong>. Symposium organizers will be 
informed of the Program Committee's decision prior to the deadline for submitting contributed 
papers (March 1, 2014).

<p>
Symposia should involve several presenters, typically 4-5, organized around a topic of 
interest. A selection of symposia will be accepted for presentation at the PSA 2014 meeting. 
Symposium presenters may submit their papers, after the conference, for review for publication 
in a supplementary issue of <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>. The evaluation for publication will be of 
individual papers. Symposium papers may be posted as a PSA 2014 Conference Paper at 
<a href="http://philsciarchive.pitt.edu">http://philsciarchive.pitt.edu</a> (a publicly accessible digital archive) prior to the meeting.  All symposium papers submitted for review after the meeting may be electronically archived, whether or not 
they are accepted for publication. The submission deadline for symposium papers will be 
announced at a later date.
</p>
<p>
The Committee aims to prepare a program that reflects the full range of current work in the 
philosophy of science. Symposia that make connections with, or include, working scientists, as 
well as symposia of potential interest to members of both the Philosophy of Science Association 
and the History of Science Society are warmly invited. We will not be considering 'Author 
Meets Critics' sessions (but topical sessions that build upon recently published books are 
acceptable).
</p>
<p>
Proposals must include sufficient supporting material to permit the program committee to 
evaluate the quality and interest of the symposium. Proposals for symposia should include: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>The title of the proposed symposium </li>
<li>A short descriptive summary of the proposal (100-200 words)</li>
<li>A description of the topic and a justification of its current importance to the discipline (up to 1000 words)</li>
<li>Titles and abstracts (up to 500 words) of all papers</li>
<li>A list of participants and either an abbreviated curriculum vitae or short biographical description (not to exceed 1 page) for each participant</li>
<li>Institutional affiliation and e-mail addresses for all participants</li>
<li>Full contact information for the organizer (who may or may not be a proposed speaker), to be used for communication with the Program Committee</li>
</ol>
<p>
Submissions must be electronically submitted through the <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> Editorial 
Manager at <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/phos/" rel="external">http://www.editorialmanager.com/phos/</a>. 
First time users must register on Editorial Manager.

<p>
Please note that in accordance with current PSA policy, (1) No previously published paper may 
be presented at the PSA meeting, and (2) No one will be permitted to appear more than once in 
a substantive role on the program. (A "substantive role" is the presentation of a paper either in 
a symposium or in a contributed papers session.  A scholar may appear as co-author on more 
than one paper or symposium talk, but may only present once.)  Symposium participants are, 
therefore, encouraged to notify their symposium organizers if they submit a contributed paper 
or are involved in more than one symposium proposal. If an accepted symposium subsequently 
loses participants due to multiple submissions, acceptance of the symposium proposal will 
become contingent upon the symposium organizer developing satisfactory alternatives to 
maintain the quality and coherence of the session.
