PSA2014 Call for Papers
%%%
<p>
Submission is now open for papers to be presented at the PSA 2014 meeting Chicago, IL on
November 6-9, 2014. Contributed papers may be on any topic in the philosophy of science. The 
PSA 2014 Committee aims to prepare a program that reflects the full range of
current work in the philosophy of science and will strive for quality, variety, innovation and 
diversity on the program. Members of the PSA2014 Program Committee are listed at 
<a href="http://www.philsci.org/meetings/psa2014/index.html">http://www.philsci.org/meetings/psa2014/index.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The deadline for paper submissions is <strong>March 1, 2014</strong>. Some papers will be accepted for both 
presentation at the PSA 2014 meeting and publication in a supplementary issue of <cite>Philosophy 
of Science</cite>; other papers will be accepted for presentation only. Both types of accepted paper 
may be posted as a PSA 2014 Conference Paper at <a href="http://philsciarchive.pitt.edu">http://philsciarchive.pitt.edu</a>
(a publicly accessible digital archive) prior to the meeting. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present 
abbreviated versions of their papers at the conference (the paper presentation should take no 
more than twenty minutes). The Program Committee expects to announce its decision on papers 
for presentation by the end of May 2014 and on papers published in <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> by 
mid June. Final versions of all papers accepted for publication must be re-submitted by January 
10, 2015.

The maximum manuscript length is 5,000 words, including abstract, footnotes, and references. 
If the text includes tables or figures, an appropriate number of words should be subtracted from 
the limit. Submissions must include a 100-word abstract and a word count. Format and citation 
style should match those of <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> (see <a href="http://journal.philsci.org/format.html" rel="external">http://journal.philsci.org/format.html</a> for 
details). Submissions should be prepared for anonymous review, with no information identifying 
the author in the body of the paper or abstract. Please ensure that your paper does not contain 
information that communicates your identity to the reviewers. (See <a href="http://journal.philsci.org/submissions.html" rel="external">http://journal.philsci.org/submissions.html</a> 
for instructions on how to prepare your paper for anonymous review.) 
</p>
<p>
Submissions must be electronically submitted through the <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> Editorial 
Manager at <a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/phos/" rel="external">http://www.editorialmanager.com/phos/</a>. First time users must register on Editorial Manager.

<p>
Please note that in accordance with current PSA policy, (1) No previously published paper may 
be presented at the PSA meeting, and (2) No one will be permitted to appear more than once in 
a substantive role on the program. (A "substantive role" is the presentation of a paper either in 
a symposium or in a contributed papers session.  A scholar may appear as co-author on more 
than one paper or symposium talk, but may only present once.)  Symposium participants are, 
therefore, encouraged to notify their symposium organizers if they submit a contributed paper 
or are involved in more than one symposium proposal. If an accepted symposium subsequently 
loses participants due to multiple submissions, acceptance of the symposium proposal will 
become contingent upon the symposium organizer developing satisfactory alternatives to 
maintain the quality and coherence of the session.
