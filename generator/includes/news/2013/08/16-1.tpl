three members of the PSA Nominating Committee: Hanne Andersen, Kathleen Okruhlik, and 
P. Kyle Stanford. In its 2013 Election, the PSA will elect two members of its Governing Board,

Nominations for either position from any fifteen Full members of the PSA will appear, along 
with the candidates nominated through the standard committee process, on the ballot of the
2013 PSA Election.  In order to assure that the PSA election is conducted in a timely fashion, 
complete ballot information for candidates so nominated must be provided by <strong>November 1, 
2013.</strong> Members intending to organize such a nomination are requested to inform the Executive 
Secretary and Treasurer at <a href="mailto:psa@umbc.edu" rel="email">psa@umbc.edu</a> by <strong>October 1</strong>, 
so that we can clear time to incorporate the nominations (along with candidate information) into the ballot.

PSA members are reminded that only Full or Retired Full (as opposed to Student) members of 
the PSA are eligible to run for PSA office, nominate candidates for PSA office, and vote in PSA
elections. Full members of the PSA are PSA members with "a doctoral degree or its equivalent 
in any philosophical or scientific field, in the broadest sense of those terms; a professional
position (assistant professorship or above, or the equivalent) in any of these fields; [or] a 
professional research position in any of these fields" (PSA By-Laws, Art. II, &sect;2). In addition,
PSA members are reminded that PSA Governing Board members may not serve two consecutive terms.
