The Governing Board of the Philosophy of Science Association is pleased 
to announce that Jessica Pfeifer, Associate Professor of Philosophy at 
the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, will assume the position 
of the Executive Secretary and Treasurer of the PSA.
</p>
<p>
Professor Pfeifer received her Ph.D. in Philosophy/Science Studies from 
the University of California, San Diego and has taught at the University 
of Maryland-Baltimore County since 1998. She was a Visiting Fellow at 
the Center for Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh, \
has published papers in a range of topics in philosophy of science, and 
co-edited, with Sahotra Sarkar, <cite>The Philosophy of Science: An 
Encyclopedia, Vols. 1 &amp; 2</cite> (Routledge, 2006).
</p>
<p>
In addition to expertise she has gained as a result of her extensive 
scholarly, editorial, and administrative work within academia, Professor 
Pfeifer brings to the Philosophy of Science Association a range of 
financial and bookkeeping skills gained outside academia, skills that 
will serve the PSA well in advancing its mission of promoting research, 
teaching, and discussion of issues within the philosophy of science from 
diverse viewpoints. Professor Pfeifer is interested particularly in 
improving the PSA's institutional memory, facilitating the mentoring of 
philosophers of science at the start of their careers, and making the 
scientific community and the general public aware of the philosophy of 
science and its value in public discourse.
</p>
<p>
Professor Pfeifer has already assumed several of the jobs of the PSA 
Executive Secretary and Treasurer, including managing posts to the PSA-L 
Announcement List and the PSA jobs listing. In the near future she will 
assume all the duties of the position. Items for the PSA-L list or the 
PSA jobs listing can be brought to her attention at <a href="mailto:psa@umbc.edu" rel="email">psa@umbc.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Governing Board invites all members of the PSA and related academic 
societies to join us in congratulating Professor Pfeifer and welcoming 
her as the PSA's Executive Secretary and Treasurer.
