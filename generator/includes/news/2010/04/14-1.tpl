PSA Election Results

<p>
On behalf of the Governing Board of the Philosophy of Science Association, it is
my pleasure to announce the results of the most recent PSA election.
</p>
<p>
Stephan Hartmann of Tilburg University, Roberta Millstein of the University of
California-Davis, Nancy Nersessian of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and
Andrea Woody of the University of Washington were elected to the Governing
Board for the PSA, where each will serve a two-year term from January 1, 2010
through December 31, 2011.  The Officers of the PSA congratulate Professors
Hartmann and Millstein, and congratulate and welcome back Professors Nersessian
and Woody for their second terms on the PSA Governing Board.  The Officers also
offer deep appreciation and thanks to Craig Callender of the University of
California--San Diego and Alan HÃ¡jek of the Australian National Research
University, both of whom are stepping down from the Board after serving two
consecutive two-year terms.
</p>
<p>
Margaret Morrison of the University of Toronto, C. Kenneth Waters of the
University of Minnesota, and Alison Wylie of Cambridge University/University of
Washington were elected to serve as the new Nominating Committee for the PSA,
where each will serve a two year term beginning January 1, 2009 and ending
December 31, 2011.  Along with a congratulations to the new Nominating
Committee, the Officers of the PSA warmly thank the PSA's previous Nominating
Committee, comprised of its chair, James Joyce of the University of Michigan,
Rachel Ankeny of the University of Adelaide, and Roman Frigg of the London
School of Economics and Political Science.
</p>
<p>
The proposed amendment to the PSA's By-Laws passed, 244-15.  That means that in
the upcoming 2010 PSA Election new Governing Board members will be elected to
serve a single term of four years, and also limited to serving one consecutive
term.  The revised version of the PSA By-Laws will be posted shortly at

</p>
<p>
Finally, I am happy to report that of the 755 Full Members of the PSA eligible
to vote at the election's start, 267, or slightly more than 35%, voted
electronically in response to email solicitations.  This is a slight drop from
the 38% turn-out for 2008, possibly to be attributed to this being an
odd-numbered, and thus non-Presidential, PSA Election.
</p>
<p>
I thank those many Full PSA members took the time to vote in this election.
This PSA Election ran smoothly due in large part to the experience and
dedication of Jay Malone and his staff at the History of Science Society.  If
you are a Full Member of the PSA and you encountered problems in voting
electronically, though, or if you have any other comments, questions, or
concerns about the 2009 PSA Election, please contact me at

Sincerely,<br />
