Cushing Memorial Prize: Call for Nominations
%%%
<p>
The family, students, friends, and colleagues of Jim Cushing are pleased 
once again to solicit nominations for the James T. Cushing Prize in the 
History and Philosophy of Physics.
</p>
<p>
In recognition of Jim's well-known role as a nurturer of new talent in 
the profession, this annual prize is intended to recognize and reward 
the work of younger scholars. The next winner will receive $1,000 and an 
invitation to deliver a paper in the University of Notre Dame's History 
and Philosophy of Science Colloquium series during the 2011-2012 
academic year. 
</p>
<p>
Work is eligible by nomination only. Eligible are all papers in the 
history and philosophy of physics published by a younger scholar within 
the three years prior to the current call for nominations (i.e., 
published no earlier than October 2007). Without defining "younger 
scholar," our intention is to favor work produced by scholars who are no 
more than five years or so beyond completion of the Ph.D. or, in a 
comparable way, new to the fields of the history and philosophy of 
physics.

Nominated work will be evaluated by a committee drawn from the members 
of the <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~cushpriz/AdvisoryCommittee.htm" rel="external">Advisory Committee</a>. 
A nomination should consist of a brief description of the significance 
of the nominated work and such information about the author as the 
nominator might think helpful to the evaluation committee (e.g., an 
abbreviated c.v.).Â  The deadline for receipt of nominations is 15 March 
2011.  The winner will be announced in May 2011.
