<p>
The Society for Philosophy of Science in Practice (SPSP) aims to create an
interdisciplinary community of scholars who approach the philosophy of
science with a focus on scientific practice and the practical uses of
scientific knowledge. For further details on our objectives, see our mission
statement on our website (URL above).
</p>
<p>
The SPSP biennial conferences provide a broad forum for scholars committed
to making detailed and systematic studies of scientific practices — neither
dismissing concerns about truth and rationality, nor ignoring contextual and
pragmatic factors. The conferences aim at cutting through traditional
disciplinary barriers and developing novel approaches. We welcome
contributions from not only philosophers of science, but also philosophers
working in epistemology and ethics, as well as the philosophy of
engineering, medicine, agriculture, and other practical fields.
Additionally, we welcome contributions from historians and sociologists of
science, pure and applied scientists, and any others with an interest in
philosophical questions regarding scientific practice.
</p>
<p>
In addition to keynote lectures by invited speakers, who will include
Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent (Université Paris-X Nanterre), Philip Kitcher
(Columbia University), and Sandra Mitchell (University of Pittsburgh), the
conference will feature parallel sessions with contributed papers. For the
2011 conference, we encourage submissions on any topic related to the
organization’s objectives. For examples of previous topics, please consult
our webpage for programs from our past two conferences.
</p>
<p>
We welcome both individual papers, and also strongly encourage proposals for
whole, thematic sessions with coordinated papers, particularly those which
include multiple disciplinary perspectives and/or input from scientific
practitioners. You may wish to involve other members of SPSP (a listing is
available on our website) or post a notice to the SPSP listserv describing
your area of interest and seeking other possible participants for a session
proposal.
