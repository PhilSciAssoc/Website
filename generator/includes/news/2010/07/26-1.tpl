The John Templeton Foundation, the Society of Christian Philosophers, Oxford
University and the University of Oklahoma are pleased to announce the Templeton
Research Fellows Program for 2011-2012. This is the final year of a program

philosophers of religion and scientists. We are seeking highly-qualified Fellows
with an established record of successful publication, and whose proposed
research will open up new avenues for interdisciplinary growth in the philosophy
of religion. Applicants must have a Ph.D. prior to application and be affiliated
with an accredited institution.

Two of the fellowships will be given to applicants proposing research at the
interface of philosophy of religion and philosophy of physics, cosmology,
mathematics, logic, or the natural sciences. One of the fellowships will be
given to an applicant proposing research in any area of the philosophy of
religion.

We invite recent Ph.D.'s and more advanced scholars to apply for a year-long
fellowship in residence at Oxford University for the opportunity to engage in
sustained interaction with some of the worldâ€™s foremost philosophers,
scientists, theologians, and other specialists in religion. Three scholars will
be chosen as research Fellows for the 2011-2012 year of the program (two junior
and one senior). A Junior Fellow will receive a stipend of $50,000. A Senior
Fellow will receive a stipend of $70,000. In addition, there will be funds for
relocation, travel, research, etc.
