<p>
PHILADELPHIA, PAâ€”27 May 2010 -- Every four years the History of Science Society,
the British Society for the History of Science, and the Canadian Society for the
History &amp; Philosophy of Science meet jointly in mid-summer for multi-day
sessions on the history of science. The "Three Societies Meeting" alternates
among the US, Canada, and the UK. The History of Science Society will serve as
host in 2012 and, thanks to a proposal submitted by the Philadelphia Area Center
for History of Science, Philadelphia will provide the venue for this Three
Societies Meeting.
</p>
<p>
The conference will attract hundreds of historians of science to Old City for
the meetings.  The main venues for the sessions will be the meeting rooms at the
American Philosophical Society, the Chemical Heritage Foundation, and the
University of Pennsylvania.  Attendees will stay in Old City hotels.  Dorm rooms
will be available as low-cost alternative housing.

"The history of science in America begins in Philadelphia," said Robert (Jay)
Malone, Executive Director of the History of Science Society. "Benjamin Franklin,
Benjamin Rush, and Joseph Priestley were among the first men of science in
America and they were Philadelphians.  It will be a great pleasure to bring
together the leading scholars in the history of science here in the city where
American science began."
</p>
<p>
Previous Three Society Meetings were at Oxford, UK (2008); Halifax, Nova Scotia
(2004); St Louis (2000), Edinburgh (1996), and Toronto (1992).
