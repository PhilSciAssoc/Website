Dear colleague,
</p>
<p>
We would like to draw your attention to the 7th International Symposium on
Imprecise Probability: Theories and Applications, which be held at the
University of Innsbruck from July 25 to July 28, 2011.
</p>
<p>
The ISIPTA meetings are one of the primary international forums to present
and discuss new results on the theories and applications of imprecise
probability.
</p>
[split here]
<p>
Imprecise probability is a generic term for the many mathematical or
statistical models which allow us to measure chance or uncertainty without
using sharp numerical probabilities.
These models include lower and upper expectations or previsions, interval
valued probabilities, sets of probability measures, belief functions,
Choquet capacities, comparative probability orderings, possibility
measures, plausibility measures, and sets of desirable gambles.  Imprecise
probability models are needed in inference and decision problems where the
relevant information is scarce, vague or conflicting, and where preferences
may be incomplete.
