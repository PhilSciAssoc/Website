CAMBRIDGE, MA -- Over the past 230 years, the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences has accumulated a large collection of documents, records, and objects
that help tell the story of the nation's intellectual development since the
latter part of the 18th century. Now the public is being offered a glimpse into
that history through a new web-based feature, From the Academy Archives.
</p>
<p>
To commemorate its founding on May 4, 1780, the Academy announced the new online
resource, located on its web site at
<a href="http://www.amacad.org/" rel="external">http://www.amacad.org/</a>.
</p>
<p>
The site will highlight one or more significant events from the Academy's
history that occurred during a given month.  For example, during the month of
May:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 1780, the Academy's charter was approved by the Massachusetts legislature.
Among the sixty-two incorporating members were leaders in the movement for
American independence, including Samuel Adams, John Adams, James Bowdoin, John
Hancock, and Robert Treat Paine. The charter also named prominent ministers,
educators, judges, lawyers, physicians, and businessmen.
</p>
<p>
In 1852, medical doctor and Fellow Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., spoke at an
Academy meeting on "The Use of Direct Light in Microscopic Researches."
</p>
<p>
In 1876, the Academy's Recording Secretary presented a paper by Alexander Graham
Bell "On Telegraphing Musical Sounds," later published in the Academy's
Proceedings as "Researches in Telephony." In the paper, Bell described past work
in the field and explained his recent experiments in transmitting both pure
musical tones and human speech.
</p>
<p>
In 1927, Herbert E. Ives spoke at the Academy on "Television" with lantern slide
illustrations. A researcher at AT&amp;T, Ives had given the first public
demonstration of television transmission a month earlier.
</p>
<p>
In 1952, the Academy sponsored a two-day "Symposium on Climatic Change," chaired
by astronomer and past president Harlow Shapley. Speakers from the fields of
astronomy, geology, geography, meteorology, paleontology, paleoanthropology,
geophysics and geochemistry examined both the scientific basis for climatology
and the role climate change has played in the development of life and human
culture.
</p>
<p>
And in 1956, the Academy held a two-day conference on "Science and the Modern
World View -- Toward a Common Understanding of the Sciences and the Humanities."

"This initiative to link the past work of the Academy with our vital activities
of today is made possible by our ongoing efforts to catalog and conserve the
Academy's rich archive," said Chief Executive Officer Leslie Berlowitz.
</p>
<p>
Founded in 1780, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences is an independent
policy research center that conducts multidisciplinary studies of complex and
emerging problems. Current Academy research focuses on science and technology
policy; global security; social policy; the humanities and culture; and
education. With headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Academy's work is
advanced by its 4,600 elected members, who are leaders in the academic
disciplines, the arts, business and public affairs from around the world.
