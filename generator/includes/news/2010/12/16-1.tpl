All award recipients receive a $250 prize and join a long list of highly accomplished
philosophers and leading scholars in the field. PSA President Nancy Cartwright, of the London
School of Economics and the University of California—San Diego, joined others in recognizing the
extraordinary achievement of these young scholars. "These are among our very best philosophers,
and it is a real pleasure to be able to recognize their work in a concrete and public way." "These
contests are never easy to judge," added Gary Hardcastle, the PSA's Executive Secretary and
Treasurer, "and I understand the competition was especially keen this year."

Winners of the PSA Graduate Student Essay Award and the PSA Recent Ph. D. Essay Award
are selected by a committee of senior philosophers of science chaired by Jeffrey Barrett of the
University of California-Irvine, the Editor-in-Chief of Philosophy of Science.
The Philosophy of Science Association Women's Caucus gave its inaugural award for the best
published book, article, or book chapter, in English, in feminist philosophy of science. The 2010

and Philosophy, 2010) and Elisabeth Lloyd of Indiana University for her book, <cite>The Case of
the Female Orgasm</cite> (Harvard, 2005). Each recipient received a $250 cash prize, made possible by
