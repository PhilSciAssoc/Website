<p>
Notre Dame's History and Philosophy of Science Graduate Program is 
pleased to announce the launch of its new Theology and Science track. 
Modeled after our existing history and philosophy tracks, the Theology 
and Science track will function in close collaboration with Notre Dame's 
theology department. Students on this new track will complete what is, 
in most respects, a standard theology Ph.D. plus the specific HPS 
requirements.

More information about the new track can be found on the ND HPS website:

We are now accepting applications for study on the new track starting in 
fall 2011, with an application deadline of January 15, 2011.
