The goal of this conference is to bring together scholars working in moral and
political philosophy, social epistemology, philosophy of science, and related
areas to reflect broadly on the relationships between science, knowledge, and
democracy.  We aim to explore questions such as the following.  In what ways
should we be seeking to foster democratic influences on science, and why?  Can
we unpack the concept of objectivity (whether in the scientific or the political
domain) more fruitfully by shifting from an individual to a social level of
analysis?  What is the nature of "lay expertise," and what are its implications
for pursuing public participation in scientific research and policy making? Do
various forms of "epistemic injustice" detract from scientific knowledge or
political decision making? What are the implications of political theory for
thinking about how to democratize science and to integrate scientific knowledge
into policy making?  Does governmental involvement in and funding of scientific
research pose special challenges to traditional epistemic and moral
justifications for democracy?

The Three Rivers Philosophy (TRiP) Conference takes its name from the University
of South Carolina's location in Columbia, the state capital, where the Saluda
and Broad Riversmeet to form the Congaree River.  April is a beautiful time to
be in South Carolina, so come and enjoy both our wonderful weather and what
promises to be a very fruitful intellectual exchange.  If you have any questions
about the conference, please contact one of the organizers: Kevin Elliott
(<a href="mailto:ke@sc.edu" rel="email">ke@sc.edu</a>) or Justin Weinberg (<a href="mailto:jweinberg@sc.edu">jweinberg@sc.edu</a>).
