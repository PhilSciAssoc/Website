<p>
The Society for Philosophy of Science in Practice (SPSP) aims to create an
interdisciplinary community of scholars who approach the philosophy of science
with a focus on scientific practice and the practical uses of scientific
knowledge. For further details on our objectives, see our mission statement on
our website (URL above).
</p>
<p>
The SPSP biennial conferences provide a broad forum for scholars committed to
making detailed and systematic studies of scientific practices — neither
dismissing concerns about truth and rationality, nor ignoring contextual and
pragmatic factors. The conferences aim at cutting through traditional
disciplinary barriers and developing novel approaches. We welcome contributions
from not only philosophers of science, but also philosophers working in
epistemology and ethics, as well as the philosophy of engineering, medicine,
agriculture, and other practical fields. Additionally, we welcome contributions
from historians and sociologists of science, pure and applied scientists, and
any others with an interest in philosophical questions regarding scientific
practice.
</p>
<p>
In addition to keynote lectures by invited speakers, who will include Bernadette
Bensaude-Vincent (Université Paris-X Nanterre), Philip Kitcher (Columbia
University), and Sandra Mitchell (University of Pittsburgh), the conference
will feature parallel sessions with contributed papers. For the 2011 conference,
we encourage submissions on any topic related to the organization’s objectives.
For examples of previous topics, please consult our webpage for programs from
our past two conferences.
</p>
<p>
We welcome both individual papers, and also strongly encourage proposals for
whole, thematic sessions with coordinated papers, particularly those which
include multiple disciplinary perspectives and/or input from scientific
practitioners. You may wish to involve other members of SPSP (a listing is
available on our website) or post a notice to the SPSP listserv describing your
area of interest and seeking other possible participants for a session proposal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Individual paper proposals:</strong> must include a title and an abstract of 500 words,
and full contact information for the speaker(s).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Session proposals:</strong> must include an overall title for the session,
a title and 500-word abstract for each paper (or an equivalent amount of depth
and detail, if the format of the proposed session is a less traditional one),
and full contact information for each contributor. Session proposals should be
submitted as a group by the organizer of the session.
</p>
<p>
Multiple submissions of any form by the same person will not be allowed. Please
direct all queries to <a href="mailto:info.spsp@gw.utwente.nl" rel="email">info.spsp@gw.utwente.nl</a>.
