Annual Report of the Editor-in-Chief of <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>
%%%
<p>
I am pleased to report that <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> is caught up in
its publication schedule. This could not have been done without the excellent
service of both the Editorial Board, several of whom have advised the journal on
as many as six papers over the last year, and the many PSA members who have also
served as referees.
</p>
<p>
Over the twelve months we received 357 regular journal submissions, not
including book reviews and PSA 2008 and 2010 submissions. The overall mean time
to first decision on regular submissions was 37 days, which is within our
two-month goal. Accepted papers and rejected papers had shorter mean times to
first decisions, 25 and 33 days respectively.
</p>
<p>
Conditional accept and encourage to resubmit decisions typically took longer
than simple accept and reject decisions, with mean times to decision of 54 and
63 days respectively. This is largely due to referees and editors spending more
time on these papers both providing advice to the author and explaining the
conditions under which the paper might be accepted. That said, the mean time of
63 days is just outside the two-month goal, and hence represents an opportunity
for us to improve this aspect of the review process.
</p>
<p>
PSA members have typically agreed to review when asked and most have
subsequently submitted their reviews within 14 days. This is an excellent
turnaround time in providing advice.
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for your service to the journal and to the PSA.
</p>
<p>
Best wishes,<br />
Jeffrey Barrett, Editor-in-Chief
