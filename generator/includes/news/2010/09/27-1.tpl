Maggie Osler, 1942-2010

<p>
Margaret J. Osler passed away on 15 Sept 2010, shortly after being 
diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Maggie -- as she was called by 
everyone but her mother -- served as the History of Science Socidety 
Secretary from 2001 until her death. She was a devoted officer and 
member throughout her many years of service, filling stints on HSS 
Council, as well as numerous committees, giving literally thousands of 
hours of service to the HSS. She brought both irreverence and high 
academic standards to officers' meetings, insisting on close textual 
readings and encouraging everyone to sing old labor songs (a by product, 
she would tell us, of being raised by lefty, intellectual parents who 
were so enamored with socialism that their only daughter's middle name, 
Jo, was a tribute to Joseph Stalin).

Born in New York in 1942, Maggie's birth saw many complications and she 
almost lost her mother. Maggie's story about this episode, how her 
father -- some would say miraculously -- was able to save her mother, is 
a vivid depiction of the tension between faith and reason. Her family 
moved to Baltimore while she was still a child, and it was in Baltimore, 
as a young student, that she exhibited her highly developed sense of 
right and wrong, even picketing businesses that refused to serve African 
Americans -- a risky proposition for a young woman during the civil 
rights era of Baltimore. She excelled as a student and attended 
Swarthmore College, a place that she loved. After graduation in 1963, 
she entered graduate school at Indiana University, in Bloomington, 
Indiana, where she worked with Sam Westfall. After graduating in 1968 
with her PhD in the history and philosophy of science, she struggled to 
find her place, but after brief stints at Wake Forest University, Harvey 
Mudd College, Oregon State University and driving a cab, she settled 
happily at the University of Calgary in 1975, in Alberta, Canada, where 
she worked until her death. During her scholarly career, she became one 
of the worldâ€™s experts on the work of Pierre Gassendi and the early 
modern period. Her latest book, <cite>Reconfiguring the World: Nature, God, 
and Human Understanding from the Middle Ages to Early Modern Europe</cite> 
was just published by Johns Hopkins University Press.

Maggie loved life, finding humor (and anti-Semitic plots) in almost 
every imaginable circumstance (as well as those that defied imagination). 
Her irrepressible sense of humor, her forthright nature, and her acute 
understanding of humanity allowed her to form friendships with a 
stunningly broad range of individuals, bringing together the most 
unlikely of suspects. She was a fierce defender of those whom she liked 
and these friends have suffered an irreparable loss.
