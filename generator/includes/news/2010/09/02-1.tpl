2011-12 Visiting Fellowships in the Sydney Centre for the Foundations of Science
%%%
<p>
We are currently inviting applications for one-semester visiting 
fellowships at The University of Sydney, for either second semester 
(August to November) 2011 or first semester (February to May) 2012. This 
program is associated with The Sydney Centre for the Foundations of 
Science (SCFS), a research centre sponsoring work into the logical, 
philosophical and historical foundations of science (further details 
below). We are hoping to receive applications from leading historians 
and philosophers of science (including the special sciences and 
biomedical sciences) at any post-PhD career stage. This is the fifth 
round of such fellowships and we anticipate being able to offer them 
each year.

It is expected that there will be up to four fellowships per year, and 
each fellowship will come with a travelling allowance of up to AUD 6,000. 
These fellowships will provide opportunities for academics on sabbatical 
from their home institution to spend a semester in a productive and 
collegial research environment (in a beautiful city), to work with 
members of the SCFS and with other visiting fellows. The stipend is to 
help offset some of the travelling and living-away-from-home expenses. 
The successful applicants will be expected to work on a specific 
research project that is of interest to members of the SCFS. One of the 
aims of the SCFS is to strengthen international links in history and 
philosophy of science, so expressions of interest from researchers 
outside Australia are particularly encouraged.

<p>
Applications should including a cover letter, a CV, and a brief outline 
of the proposed research project (including why you wish to pursue the 
research at the University of Sydney and which members of the SCFS team 
you anticipate collaborating with). Applications should be sent 
(preferably electronically) to:
