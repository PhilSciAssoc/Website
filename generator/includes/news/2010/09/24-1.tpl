Please join us for an interdisciplinary conference from October 7-10, at 
the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada.
<strong>Integrating Complexity: Environment and History</strong> will 
consist of two linked workshops exploring a set of challenges to 
scientific understanding that span many fields of the natural and human 
sciences, and that have broad implications for research choices, for 
social policy, and for scientific understanding. The two workshop themes 
are <strong>Organism-Environment Interaction: Past, Present and Future</strong> 
and <strong>Methodology in the Historical Sciences</strong>.

This is an Off-Year Workshop for the International Society for the 
History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology, and is sponsored by 
the Rotman Institute of Science and Values and SSHRC.
