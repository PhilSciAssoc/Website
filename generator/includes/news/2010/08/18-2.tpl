<h3>News</h3>
<p>
Our 7-year project to create a network of activities and partnerships around the
social study of science has been progressing well. We're just finish off our
third year of activities, and we can boast a number of very successful workshops,
conferences, lecture series, summer school, plus a revamped website with
database! <a href="http://www.situsci.ca" rel="external">http://www.situsci.ca</a>
</p>
<p>
The summer has been busy with a great lineup of workshops from last year,
"Scientific Models and Simulations" Workshop (May, University of Toronto) and
"The Role of Thought Experiments in Empirical Investigations" (June, Dalhousie
University).
</p>
<p>
We also had stellar lineups for an "Objectivity" conference in Vancouver and an
exciting international "Circulating Knowledge, East and West" conference in
Halifax. We look forward to "Making Knowledge: Science, Art, and Instruments in
Early Modern Europe" Workshop at McGill University in September. Among other
things, the Centre is also supporting the annual Canada Science and Technology
Museum summer institute, Rob Wilson’s Atlantic Region Philosophers Association
visit for their annual meeting in October, many local "Node" events, another
national lecture series (below) and another lineup of workshops (below).
</p>

<h3>Lecture Series Announcement</h3>
<p>
ointly with the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Public Affairs (CCEPA), "Situating
Science" is organising a national public lecture series: "Science and its
Publics", with lectures on the public space of science in politics, media and
civil society.
</p>
<p>
The series will be opened here in Halifax in early October. We will be teamed
with the new national "Canadian Science and Media Centre" to help launch the
local Atlantic chapter: <a href="http://www.sciencemediacentre.ca/smc/" rel="external">http://www.sciencemediacentre.ca/smc/</a>.
For the event we will be holding a panel discussion on science and journalism,
moderated by Jay Ingram of the Discovery Channel (confirmed) with local
representatives of science and media.
</p>
<p>
Teamed with the Making Publics project (MaPs: <a href="http://makingpublics.mcgill.ca/" rel="external">http://makingpublics.mcgill.ca/</a>)
the series will continue during the November HSS/PSA annual meeting in Montreal,
setting the stage for exploring the context of "publics".
</p>
<p>
The series plans to travel to Toronto, Ottawa-Halifax, Vancouver and
Edmonton-Calgary, touching on the role of consensus, bridging the lay-expert
divide, the role of museums and public translation of medical knowledge. Stay
tuned!

<h4>Situating Science: Cluster in the Humanist and Social Studies of Science</h4>
<p>
CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS:
</p>
<p>
<em>Situating Science</em> is a SSHRC-funded Strategic Knowledge Cluster,
mandated to build networks among scholars, Canadian and international, in the
various disciplines engaged in the humanistic and social study of science and
technology, and to engage the work of these scholars with the wider Canadian
public.
</p>
<p>
<em>Situating Science</em> is soliciting workshop proposals for the 2010 - 2011
academic year. Up to two workshops will be funded (up to $10,000 each). Workshop
topics should fall under one of the four themes of the Cluster:
</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Science and its Publics</li>
<li>Historical Epistemology and Ontology (including philosophy of science)</li>
<li>Material Culture and Scientific/Technological Practices</li>
<li>Geography and Sites of Knowing</li>
</ul>
<p>
Detailed information on the themes can be found at <a href="http://www.situsci.ca" rel="external">http://www.situsci.ca</a>.
The themes are intended to be broad and flexible. If in doubt as to whether your
proposed topic fits within one of the themes, contact your local SituSci
organisers or the SituSci central office (contact info below).
</p>
<p>
In accordance with SituSci’s mandate, organisers are encouraged to seek
inter-disciplinary participation (from within and/or outside the academy), and,
where feasible, include a public component to their event. We also entertain
proposals that include plans for an associated pedagogical component (e.g., 2-3
day "school").
</p>
<p>
The Cluster will provide financial and organisational support, with the
expectation that organisers will leverage additional funding from partnering
institutions.
</p>
<p>
The Proposal should be no more than three pages, including:
</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>Workshop title</li>
<li>Cluster theme under which workshop falls</li>
<li>Short description of workshop</li>
<li>Possible participants</li>
<li>Preliminary budget</li>
<li>Potential sources of outside funding</li>
<li>Possible inter-disciplinary partnerships (e.g., museums, journalists, etc.)</li>
