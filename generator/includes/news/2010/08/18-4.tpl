A conference in memory of David C. Gooding's contribution to the
understanding of science will be held. In recognition of his many
contributions, papers will be given by speakers who knew David and by
those whose work reflects his spirit of creative inquiry into the
nature and practices of science.

<p>
David Gooding (1947-2009) received his Ph.D. in Philosophy of Science
from Oxford University. But his many contributions transcend any easy
disciplinary boundaries. His papers and books in the history of
science, philosophy of science, cognitive science, and the social
studies of science brought new awareness of the nature and sources of
Michael Faraday's work, and, more generally, of the role of
experimentation and visualization in theory development in science.
His methodological approaches pioneered and extended the use of
diagrammatic representations of scientific thinking, the computer
simulation of scientific thinking, and revivified historical,
historical-cognitive, and philosophical approaches.

<p>
We believe a conference that celebrates and extends knowledge of
scientific thinking is the best memorial for this outstanding scholar
and thinker. Please join us.
