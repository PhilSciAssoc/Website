This conference will examine ground-level debates about metaphysics within the
philosophy of physics and the philosophy of biology as well as broader
methodological questions about the role of metaphysics in the philosophy of
science. Participation is open and welcome from all parties to these questions:
from those who hold that metaphysics must have a place within the philosophy of
science, to those who hold it should not.
