<p>
From climate change to the classification of illegal drugs the extent to which
scientific opinion should prevail over other voices in determining public policy
is hotly contested. What is it about the nature of science that confers
epistemic authority on scientific opinion, and what are the scope and limits of
that authority?
</p>
<p>
The aim of this conference is to direct the attention of philosophers of science
and epistemologists back to this question, and to remind ourselves that the
founders of philosophy of science saw this as a fundamental question for
scientific epistemology. We believe that recent developments in philosophy of
science offer new resources to address the question in ways that have direct
relevance to the practice of contemporary science and its application in public
policy.
