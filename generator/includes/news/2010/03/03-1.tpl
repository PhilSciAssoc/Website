AAAS Call for Symposia
%%%
<p>
Want to reach a broad audience of scientists and the scientifically interested
public?  The AAAS call for symposia is now open.  Section L (History and
Philosophy of Science) are seeking symposia to put forward for the 2011 meeting
in Washington, D.C. (Feb. 18-21), on the theme of Science without Borders.
</p>
<p>
The general call is here: <a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2010/program/symposia/submit/" rel="external">http://www.aaas.org/meetings/2010/program/symposia/submit/</a>.
</p>
<p>
The final deadline for submission is April 27, 2010.   But in order for Section
L to help with proposals, symposia need to submitted to any member of the
steering committee of Section L much sooner, preferably by April 1.

The following are the necessary parts for a proposal:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Title (no more than 85 characters)</li>
    <li>Synopsis (1500 characters)</li>
    <li>Relation to annual theme (for 2011:  Science without Borders) or
        relevance to general science audience (e.g. “cross-cutting activities in
        support of science, technology, and education”)  (500 characters)</li>
    <li>Scheduling requirements:
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>90 minutes: 3 speakers with 15-30 min. of discussion</li>
            <li>180 minutes: 4-6 speakers with discussion</li>
        </ul>
        Longer symposia require additional justification (1000 characters)</li>
    <li>Participants (organizer, speaker, moderator, discussants, etc.) and Contact information
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Max. of one moderator/session</li>
            <li>Max. 1 discussant/ 90 minute session</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>Presentation titles for each speaker (max. 85 characters) and proposed
        content or perspective of the speaker, giving reasons for why the
        speaker will enhance the content of the session (abstracts will be
        sought after symposia are selected).</li>
</ol>
<p>
Generally, sessions with broad appeal on topics of general interest to scientists
and the public have the best chance.
Interdisciplinary and diverse panels will also do better.
