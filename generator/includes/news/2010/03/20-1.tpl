New Editors Needed for the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science
%%%
<p>
The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science is published for
The British Society for the Philosophy of Science by Oxford
University Press. As the current editors are coming to the end of
their term, the Society invites suitably qualified individuals who
would like to be considered for the post of editor to contact the
secretary. Potential editors must be members of the BSPS, and should
preferably be based in Britain. At present the journal is run by two
co-editors and an editorial assistant, but the future structure of
an editorial team is open for negotiation.

If you would be interested in being considered as a future editor of
the journal can you please email Rachel Cooper <a href="mailto:r.v.cooper@lancaster.ac.uk" rel="email">r.v.cooper@lancaster.ac.uk</a>
by the 31st May. Please include a brief CV, a statement that
describes why you would like to be considered for the post, and also
an outline of the editorial structure you would propose (for
example, the committee is prepared to consider applications from
potential co-editors, or suggestions for larger editorial teams).
Potential applicants are also encouraged to email Rachel Cooper
prior to the deadline to begin informal discussions.

<p>
Please note that the editors of the British Journal for the
Philosophy of Science are not paid a salary, but receive a small
honorarium. Funds are available for a part-time editorial assistant.
The new editors will take over editorial responsibility for the
Journal at Christmas 2010 or as soon as possible thereafter.
