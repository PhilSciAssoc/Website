The University of Chicago Press and the International Society for the History of
Philosophy of Science are pleased to announce the launch of the society's new
journal entitled HOPOS. In advance of a formal launch event to be held this June
at the society's biennial meeting in Budapest, Hungary, the editors are seeking
submissions for the journal’s first issue, scheduled for online and print
publication in spring 2011.

HOPOS seeks to publish the highest-quality scholarship concerning the history of
philosophical discussions about science. The history of philosophy of science is
broadly construed to include topics in the history of related disciplines, in all
time periods, and all geographical areas, using diverse methodologies. HOPOS
scholarship is firmly concerned with situating philosophical understandings of
science within the broader historical and philosophical settings in which they
were developed, and against the backdrop of mainstream issues in philosophical
thought, covering epistemological, methodological, metaphysical, and moral issues
relevant to the growth of our knowledge of the world and human nature.
</p>
<p >
Our aims in publishing this journal are threefold. First, the journal provides
an outlet for interdisciplinary work, which is not often easy to publish in
existing journals due to both subject matter and length restrictions that do not
allow for the extensive bibliographical references so often required in works
that are of both a philosophical and a historical nature.
</p>
<p >
Second, the journal is devoted to raising the level of work in the history of
philosophy of science by publishing scholarship that helps to explain the links
among philosophy, science, and mathematics, along with the social, economic, and
political context, which is indispensable for a genuine understanding of the
history of philosophy. Finally, the journal is meant to increase the already
unusually high level of cooperation among international scholars in the history
of the philosophy of science.

Rose-Mary Sargent of Merrimack College will serve as the journal's first editor,
along with co-editors Menachem Fisch of Tel Aviv University, Don Howard of the
University of Notre Dame and Laura J. Snyder of St. John’s University. Warren
Schmaus of Illinois Institute of Technology will serve as book review editor.
</p>
<p >
Each issue will contain a minimum of four articles (with a flexible length
requirement), an essay book review of between 5,000 and 10,000 words, and 6 to
10 shorter (1500 word) reviews.  Annually, the journal will publish an extensive
review of the recent scholarship in a growing area of our field. Articles will
be blind reviewed by two or three referees.
</p>
<p >
The journal does not limit submissions to HOPOS members.  Scholars from all
related disciplines are encouraged to submit.
