<p>
It is with pleasure that we announce the upcoming 14th Congress of
Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science, a leading congress in
its field, which will be held on July 19-26, 2011, in Nancy (France).
The Congress will feature more than 50 invited speakers, several
plenary symposia and lectures, as well as a general program for a
wider audience. For the first time in its history, the Congress
presents a special topic of interest that will be the focus of a
series of lectures and symposia: "Logic and Science Facing the New Technologies"
</p>
<p>
The four main sections of the Congress will be:
</p>
<ol class="Letters">
    <li>Logic</li>
    <li>General Philosophy of Science</li>
    <li>Methodological and Philosophical Issues of Particular Sciences</li>
    <li>Methodological and Philosophical Issues in Technology</li>
</ol>
<p>
Also for the first time, there will be a call for contributed symposia
in addition to the call for contributed papers. Both calls will be
issued on 1 June 2010, with 31 October 2010 being the submission
deadline.

individual paper or symposium proposal can be stated there as well.
