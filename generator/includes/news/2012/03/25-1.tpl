<h3>The Hempel Award</h3>
<h4>Recognizing Lifetime Scholarly Achievement in the Philosophy of Science</h4>
<p>
The Governing Board of the Philosophy of Science Association is pleased 
to announce the Hempel Award, a biennial award recognizing lifetime 
scholarly achievement in the philosophy of science. The Hempel Award is 
named in honor of Carl Gustav Hempel (1905-1997), one of the twentieth 
century's leading philosophers of science and an active PSA member for 
over fifty years. At the invitation of the Governing Board, Carl 
Hempel's children, Miranda and Peter Hempel, will announce and present 
the inaugural Hempel Award prior to the PSA Presidential Address at 
PSA2012 in San Diego, California, November 15-17, 2012.
</p>
<p>
The Prize Committee for the Hempel Award will consist of the current PSA 
Governing Board or its designated subcommittee. Nominations for the 
Hempel Award should include a CV and between three and five letters of 
support; the latter should address the nominee's scholarly achievements, 
construed broadly to include not only the specific research of the 
nominee but also the nominee's larger impact on the scholarly community 
of philosophers of science (including training and mentorship, public 
outreach, professional work for the Philosophy of Science Association, 
and other community-building activities). Self-nominations will be 
accepted. Nominees and nominators should be members of the Philosophy of 
Science Association.
