The Society for Philosophy of Science in Practice (SPSP) aims to create 
an interdisciplinary community of scholars who approach the philosophy 
of science with a focus on scientific practice and the practical uses of 
scientific knowledge. For further details on our objectives, see our 
mission statement at: 
<a href="http://www.philosophy-science-practice.org/en/mission-statement/" rel="external">http://www.philosophy-science-practice.org/en/mission-statement/</a>
</p>
<p>
The SPSP biennial conferences provide a broad forum for scholars 
committed to making detailed and systematic studies of scientific 
practices -- neither dismissing concerns about truth and rationality, 
nor ignoring contextual and pragmatic factors. The conferences aim at 
cutting through traditional disciplinary barriers and developing novel 
approaches. We welcome contributions from not only philosophers of 
science, but also philosophers working in epistemology and ethics, as 
well as the philosophy of engineering, technology, medicine, agriculture, 
and other practical fields. Additionally, we welcome contributions from 
historians and sociologists of science, pure and applied scientists, and 
any others with an interest in philosophical questions regarding 
scientific practice. 
</p>
<p>
We welcome both individual papers, and also strongly encourage proposals 
for whole, thematic sessions with coordinated papers, particularly those 
which include multiple disciplinary perspectives and/or input from 
scientific practitioners. You may wish to involve other members of SPSP 
(a listing is available on our website) or post a notice to the SPSP 
mailing list describing your area of interest and seeking other possible 
participants for a session proposal. (To post to this list, please send 
your email to: <a href="mailto:spsp-members@philosophy-science-practice.org" rel="email">spsp-members@philosophy-science-practice.org</a>. 
Only members can post to this list).
