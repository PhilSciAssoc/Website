PSA2012: Call for Volunteer Session Chairs
%%%
<p>
Session chairs for PSA2012 will be selected from a pool of volunteers. 
Those interested in chairing a session at PSA2012 must complete the 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&amp;formkey=dDR1Rm0wWm54LXQ1V2lGSHZFNlJtdkE6MQ" rel="external">PSA2012 Chair Volunteer Form</a>. 
Prospective volunteers are urged to read 
the following from Andrea Woody, PSA2012 Program Chair:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The number of requests we can accommodate will depend on the number of 
requests we receive; we will have approximately 30 sessions in need of 
chairs. Priority will be given to those who have the relevant expertise 
for the topic of the session, those who submitted a contributed paper or 
symposium material for PSA2012 that was not accepted for the program, 
and those who are PSA members. As no one may appear more than once in a 
substantive role on the PSA2012 program, those already on the PSA2012 
program should not volunteer to chair (those on the HSS program are not, 
however, barred from also appearing on the PSA2012 program).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Volunteers for chairing at PSA2012 should complete the online form. If 
you encounter difficulty completing the online form, please contact 
Gary Hardcastle (<a href="mailto:ghardcas@bloomu.edu" rel="email">ghardcas@bloomu.edu</a>) 
or Andrea Woody (<a href="mailto:awoody@u.washington.edu" rel="email">awoody@u.washington.edu</a>).
