%%%
<p>
San Diego, CA, USA<br />
15-18 November 2012<br />
(Joint meeting with PSA)
</p>
<p>
The History of Science Society will hold its 2012 Annual Meeting in the 
Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We will be meeting with our 
colleagues from the Philosophy of Science Association and will open our 
conferences with a joint plenary on Kuhn's Structure of Scientific 
Revolutions, 50 years later. Registration for one conference will 
entitle the registrant to attend the sessions for both conferences. 
There will be an administrative fee for any individual who appears on 
more than one program.
</p>
<p>
All proposals (sessions, contributed papers, and posters) must be 
submitted by 2 April 2012 to the History of Science Society's Executive 
Office (short abstract, up to 250 words). Poster proposals must describe 
the visual material that will make up the poster. The HSS will work with 
organizers who wish to precirculate papers.
</p>
<p>
Submissions on all topics are encouraged. All proposals must be 
submitted on the HSS Web site (<a href="http://www.hssonline.org" rel="external">http://www.hssonline.org</a>) 
or on the annual meeting proposal forms that are available from the HSS 
Executive Office. HSS members are asked to circulate this announcement 
to non-HSS colleagues who may be interested in presenting a paper or 
poster at the Annual Meeting (all participants must register for the 
meeting). Applicants are encouraged to propose sessions that include 
diverse participants: a mix of men and women, and/or a balance of 
professional ranks (i.e., mixing senior scholars with junior scholars 
and graduate students). Strong preference will be given to panels whose 
presenters have diverse institutional affiliations. Only one proposal 
per person may be submitted. An individual may only appear once on the 
HSS program (see the guidelines for exceptions). Prior participation at 
the 2010 (Montr&eacute;al) or the 2011 (Cleveland) meetings will be 
taken into consideration.

<p>
To encourage and aid the creation of panels with strong thematic 
coherence that draw upon historians of science across institutions and 
ranks, the conference organizers have created a wiki at 
<a href="http://hssmeeting.wikia.com" rel="external">http://hssmeeting.wikia.com</a>. 
Anyone with a panel or paper idea seeking like-minded presenters should 
post and consult the postings there to round out a prospective session. 
Instructions are available on the site. Before sending a proposal to the 
HSS Office, we ask that everyone read the Committee on Meetings and 
Programs' "Guidelines for Selecting Papers, Posters, and Sessions." The 
2012 program co-chairs are Janet Browne (Harvard University) and Dave 
Kaiser (MIT).
