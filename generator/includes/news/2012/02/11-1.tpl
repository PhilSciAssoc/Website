Lakatos Award 2012
%%%
<p>
The Lakatos Award is given for an outstanding contribution to the 
philosophy of science, widely interpreted, in the form of a book 
published in English during the previous five years. It was made 
possible by a generous endowment from the Latsis Foundation. The Award 
is in memory of the former LSE professor, Imre Lakatos, and is 
administered by an international Management Committee organised from the 
LSE. The Committee, chaired by John Worrall, decides the outcome of the 
Award competition on the advice of an international, independent and 
anonymous panel of Selectors.

Imre Lakatos, who died in 1974 aged 51, had been Professor of Logic with 
special reference to the Philosophy of Mathematics at LSE since 1969. He 
joined the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method in 1960. 
Born in Hungary in 1922, he graduated (in Physics, Mathematics and 
Philosophy) from Debrecen University in 1944. He then joined the 
underground resistance. (His mother and grandmother perished in 
Auschwitz.) After the War, he was active in the Communist Party and had 
an influential position in the Ministry of Education. In 1950 he was 
arrested and spent the next three years as a political prisoner. After 
his release, he was given refuge in the Hungarian Academy of Science 
where he translated western works in science and mathematics into 
Hungarian. After the suppression of the Hungarian uprising he escaped to 
Vienna and from there, with the aid of a Rockefeller fellowship, on to 
Cambridge, England. He there wrote his (second) doctoral thesis out of 
which grew his famous Proofs and Refutations (CUP, 1976). Two volumes 
of Philosophical Papers, edited by John Worrall and Gregory Currie, 
appeared in 1978, also from CUP.
