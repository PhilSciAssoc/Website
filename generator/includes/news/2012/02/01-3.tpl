On December 31, 2011, the terms of two of the eight members of the 
current PSA Governing Board -- Nancy Nersessian and Andrea Woody -- came 
to an end, as did the terms of the three members of the PSA Nominating 
Committee: Margaret Morrison, C. Kenneth Waters, and Alison Wylie. In 
this, its 2011 Election, the PSA will elect two members of its Governing 
Board, each to serve a four-year term through December 31, 2015, and 
three members of its Nominating Committee, each to serve a two-year term 
ending December 31, 2013.
