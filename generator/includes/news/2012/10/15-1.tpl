contributions to its smooth functioning.

Consequently, the PSA Governing Board seeks applications for the post of 
PSA Executive Secretary and Treasurer. Ideally, service in this position

directed to Professor Longino. The Governing Board plans to interview 
candidates at PSA2012 in San Diego, November 15-17, and reserves the 
right to hold the search open until an appropriate candidate has been 
found. Successful candidates will have an advanced degree and a faculty

The Philosophy of Science Association is an incorporated non-profit 
501(c)(3) academic association dedicated to the promotion of research, 
teaching, and free discussion of issues in the philosophy of science 
from diverse standpoints. To this end, the PSA publishes <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>,
sponsors conferences, and awards prizes for distinguished work in the 
field. The PSA has approximately 1000 members, distributed among over 30 
countries, and is run by the PSA Governing Board, which consists of 
eight elected Board members and the PSA President, President-Elect, and 
Past-President. For more information about PSA governance see the PSA 
By-Laws at <a href="http://www.philsci.org/about/bylaws.html">http://www.philsci.org/about/bylaws.html</a>.

The PSA Executive Secretary and Treasurer supervises the business 
affairs of the Association, handling all financial matters as well as 
serving as the contact between the PSA and other business entities with 
which the PSA has professional dealings, including the History of 
Science Society and the University of Chicago Press. The Executive 
Secretary ensures that the PSA By-Laws are followed, oversees elections 
and awards, communicates with members of the Association, and, in 
conjunction with the HSS, arranges the PSA's biennial meeting. In 
addition, the Executive Secretary coordinates with the Governing Board 
and provides it with the necessary information for its smooth operation, 
in particular, quarterly financial reports and a general annual report. 
More generally, the position of Executive Secretary requires creative 
engagement with the HSS, UC Press, and other professional organizations, 
as well as with the PSA Governing Board, to achieve the goals and 
further the interests of the Association. The Executive Secretary is 
appointed for a four-year term.

Compensation for the position of Executive Secretary is negotiable. In 
the past, the PSA has been able to pay for course release for the PSA 
Executive Secretary and Treasurer.
