On December 31, 2012, two of the eight members of the current PSA 
Governing Board -- Robert Batterman and Alan Richardson -- will complete 
their terms, and PSA President-Elect Helen Longino will succeed James 
Woodward as PSA President. In its 2012 election the PSA will elect two 
members of its Governing Board, each of whom will serve a four-year term 
beginning January 1, 2013, and a President-Elect, who will serve a 
two-year term as PSA President beginning January 1, 2015.

Per the By-Laws of the Philosophy of Science Association (Art. IV, 
&sect;&sect;6-7) nominations to run for the Governing Board and the 
Presidency of the PSA may be made by any fifteen full members of the 
PSA. Accordingly the PSA Nominating Committee (Hanne Andersen, Kathleen 
Okruhlik, and P. Kyle Stanford (chair)) solicits nominations from the 
PSA membership for both the Governing Board and the Presidency of the 
PSA. Nominations should be submitted by e-mail to P. Kyle Stanford 
(stanford at uci.edu). Nominations for either office from any fifteen 
Full members of the PSA will appear on the ballot of the 2012 PSA 
Election provided they are received by <strong>November 8, 2012</strong>.

PSA members are reminded that only Full members of the PSA are eligible 
to run for PSA office and nominate candidates for PSA office, and only 
full and retired PSA members may vote in PSA elections. In addition, PSA 
members are reminded that past Presidents of the PSA may not serve a 
second term as PSA President and that Governing Board members may not 
serve two consecutive terms, with the following exception: by prior 
agreement with the PSA Governing Board, Robert Batterman and Alan 
Richardson, who volunteered to serve two-year terms on the PSA Governing 
Board in order to facilitate the recent transition to four-year terms, 
will be offered a place on the ballot for the Governing Board for the 
2012 PSA Election, to run for a full (four-year) term.
