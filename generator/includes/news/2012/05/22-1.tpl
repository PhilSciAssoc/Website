<p>
The Officers of the PSA congratulate and welcome Professors Massimi and 
W&uuml;thrich to the PSA Governing Board, and offer their deep 
appreciation to all the candidates who ran for election to the PSA 
Governing Board. The Officers also offer their deep appreciation and 
thanks to Nancy Nersessian (Georgia Institute of Technology) and Andrea 
Woody (University of Washington), each of whom are stepping down from 
the Board after serving two consecutive two-year terms. 
</p>
<p>
Hanne Andersen of Aarhus University, Kathleen Okruhlik of the University 
of Western Ontario, and P. Kyle Stanford of the University of 
California-Irvine have been elected to the PSA Nominating Committee, 
each to serve a two year term ending 12/31/13.  Again, the Officers 
congratulate and welcome Professors Andersen, Okruhlik, and Stanford to 
the PSA Nominating Committee, thank all those who ran for election to 
the PSA Nominating Committee, and thank the out-going PSA Nominating 
Committee, consisting of C. Kenneth Waters (University of Minnesota), 
Alison Wylie (University of Washington), and, as chair, Margaret 
Morrison (University of Toronto), for assembling their service to the 
PSA. In accord with PSA By-Laws, the chair of the in-coming PSA 
Nominating Committee will be elected by the PSA President, Jim Woodward.   
</p>
<p>
The measure to amend the PSA By-Laws, eliminating the category of 
Associate Member of the PSA, passed by a vote of 144 (91.14%) in favor 
to 14 (8.86%) opposed. The newly revised PSA By-Laws are available for 
your perusal <a href="[PREFIX]about/bylaws.html">on this website</a>.
</p>
<p>
The 2011 PSA Election was conducted electronically by the History of 
Science Society, under the supervision of Jay Malone. PSA members were 
solicited to vote via email. Of 577 voters eligible to vote in the 2011 
PSA election, 166 (28.77%) cast votes. The absolute number of voters in 
the 2011 election decreased 40.92% over the absolute number of voters in 
the 2010 election, and turnout in 2011 decreased 12.14 percentage points 
as compared to 2010. These substantial decreases may be attributable in 
part to a recent drop in PSA membership, the fact that this is an 
odd-year (and thus a non-presidential) election, and the fact that one, 
rather than two, reminders were sent to voters.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I thank those many Full PSA members took the time to vote in 
this election. Once again, the PSA Election ran smoothly due in large 
part to the experience and dedication of Jay Malone and his staff at the 
History of Science Society, especially Greg Macklem. If you are a Full 
Member of the PSA and you encountered problems in voting electronically, 
though, or if you have any other comments, questions, or concerns about 
the 2011 PSA Election, please contact me at <a href="mailto:ghardcas@bloomu.edu" rel="email">ghardcas@bloomu.edu</a>.
