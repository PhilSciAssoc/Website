The John J. Reilly Center for Science, Technology, and Values, along 
with the Graduate Program in History and Philosophy of Science at the 
University of Notre Dame and the Advisory Committee of the James T. 
Cushing Memorial Prize in History and Philosophy of Physics are pleased 
to announce the award of the Cushing Prize for 2012 to Dr. Hilary 
Greaves, University of Oxford.  She is being honored for her paper, 
"Towards a Geometrical Understanding of the CPT Theorem," published in 
The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science in 2010. The Cushing 
Prize carries a $1000 award plus an invitation to deliver a lecture as 
part of the History and Philosophy of Science Colloquium at the 
University of Notre Dame.

Hilary summarizes her argument in the abstract of her paper: "The CPT 
theorem of quantum field theory states that any relativistic 
(Lorentz-invariant) quantum field theory must also be invariant under 
CPT, the composition of charge conjugation, parity reversal and time 
reversal. This paper sketches a puzzle that seems to arise when one puts 
the existence of this sort of theorem alongside a standard way of 
thinking about symmetries, according to which spacetime symmetries (at 
any rate) are associated with features of the spacetime structure&hellip;.
The paper then suggests a solution to the puzzle: it is suggested that 
the CPT theorem arises because temporal orientation is unlike other 
pieces of spacetime structure, in that one cannot represent it by a 
tensor field."

Hilary was nominated for the Cushing Prize by David John Baker (winner 
of the Cushing Prize for 2010), who describes the importance of Greaves' 
paper: "The "CPT Theorem" paper constitutes a major step forward in the 
conceptual understanding of this foundationally important but 
ill-understood result in mathematical physics.  The deep puzzle Greaves 
attempts to tackle is why (as the theorem establishes) Lorentz invariant 
quantum field theories must also be invariant under the combination of 
three discrete symmetry transformations: charge conjugation (the 
interchange of positive and negative charge), parity inversion (aka 
mirror reflection) and time reversal&hellip;.She resolves the puzzle by 
showing that our use of tensors to represent fields in Minkowski 
spacetime is the true source of CPT, because it is impossible for a 
Minkowski-space tensor to represent a temporal orientation."  Baker 
lauds her overall contribution to philosophy of physics in these terms: 
"Greaves has been publishing first-class research in the philosophy of 
physics since her first year of graduate school&hellip;. It is no 
exaggeration to say that she is probably the most exciting researcher to 
earn a doctorate in the philosophy of physics within the last five years."

Hilary Greaves is Lecturer in Philosophy, Somerville College, University 
of Oxford.  She was previously a Research Fellow in Philosophy, Merton 
College, Oxford, and received her Ph.D. in Philosophy from Rutgers 
University (2008).
