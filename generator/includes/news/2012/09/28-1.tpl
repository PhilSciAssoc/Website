The Governing Board of the Philosophy of Science Association is pleased 
to announce that Bas C. van Fraassen is the recipient of the inaugural 
2012 Hempel Award, recognizing lifetime scholarly achievement in the 
philosophy of science.
</p>
<p>
Bas van Fraassen, the McCosh Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at 
Princeton University and Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at San 
Francisco State University, is the chief architect of modern empiricism 
in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. In four volumes 
-- <cite>The Scientific Image</cite> (1980) (co-recipient of the 1986 Lakatos Award), 
<cite>Laws and Symmetry</cite> (1989), <cite>The Empirical Stance</cite> (2002), 
<cite>Scientific Representation</cite> (2008) -- and dozens of articles, 
van Fraassen has produced a systematic account of science, constructive 
empiricism, which advocates a semantic approach to scientific theories 
and, on that basis, urges skepticism regarding laws of nature, 
anti-realism regarding unobservables, and pragmatism regarding 
explanation. In the three decades since its introduction, constructive 
empiricism has emerged both as a locus of outstanding scholarship in the 
philosophy of science and as an intellectual monument to Professor van 
Fraassen's exceptional philosophical insight, clarity and creativity.

Professor van Fraassen has also made foundational contributions to 
subfields within the philosophy of science, in many cases not merely 
shaping these areas of research but helping to form them. This will be 
most evident to contemporary philosophers of physics, many of whom were 
introduced to the field by van Fraassen's <cite>An Introduction to the 
Philosophy of Time and Space</cite> (1970), and who almost certainly 
have his <cite>Quantum Mechanics: An Empiricist View</cite> (1991) on 
the shelf as well. But something similar is true for several other 
fields, notably the philosophy of probability and the philosophy of 
logic. Where van Fraassen has focused his attention, the invariable 
result has been a clearer and deeper understanding of the issues for all.

<p>
Professor van Fraassen is a Fellow of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, and has served as President of the Philosophy of 
Science Association, editor of the <cite>Journal of Philosophical Logic</cite>, and 
co-editor of the <cite>Journal of Symbolic Logic</cite>. In recognition of Professor 
van Fraassen's record of scholarly achievement and service in the 
philosophy of science, and in light of the great intellectual energy, 
generosity, egalitarianism and kindness that he brought to the 
philosophy of science (including, especially, his mentoring of graduate 
students and junior scholars in philosophy of science) the Governing 
Board of the PSA congratulates Professor van Fraassen on the occasion of 
the inaugural Hempel Award.
</p>
<p>
The Hempel Award will be given every two years by the Governing Board of 
the Philosophy of Science Association, and presented at the PSA Biennial 
Meeting. At the invitation of the Governing Board, Carl Hempel's 
children, Miranda and Peter Hempel, will announce and present this 
inaugural Hempel award prior to the PSA Presidential Address at PSA2012 
in San Diego, California, November 15-17, 2012.
