All the presentation rooms at PSA2012 will be equipped with LCD 
projectors, aka beamers. Presenters in a session are encouraged to share 
a single laptop to be used for LCD projection, so that transitions 
between speakers go quickly. Presenters should also have on hand any 
necessary adapters or additional equipment required for one's own laptop. 
Presenters may request a white board, slide projector, or overhead 
projector (none of which will otherwise be present in the room); direct 
your A/V request to Gary Hardcastle (<a href="mailto:ghardcas@bloomu.edu" rel="email">ghardcas@bloomu.edu</a>) 
or Greg Macklem at the HSS (<a href="mailto:greg@hssonline.org" rel="email">greg@hssonline.org</a>). 
<strong>A/V requests must be received be November 1.</strong>
