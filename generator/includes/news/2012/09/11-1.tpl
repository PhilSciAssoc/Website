PSA2012 Preliminary Program Update Again
%%%
<p>
The most recent (9/10/12) version of the PSA2012 Program is now 
<a href="[PREFIX_FINAL]files/PSA2012_Prelim_Program-091012.pdf" rel="download">available</a>. 
It differs from the version presently posted only in the addition of 
several new session chairs.

<p>
Please take a moment and confirm that your name, affiliation, and paper 
title are correct in the program, and let me know as soon as possible if 
they are not. Symposia organizers, please check that the order of the 
papers in your session is correctly listed and, again, let me know of 
any corrections.
</p>
<p>
We will be able to accept corrections to the PSA2012 program for the 
next ten days only. Corrections received after September 20 may not 
appear in the final version of the program. Please note that we are not 
able to alter the program to accommodate travel plans or preferred 
session times. As always, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any 
questions, comments, or suggestions.

<p>
See you in San Diego!
