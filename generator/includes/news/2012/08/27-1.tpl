PSA2012 Preliminary Program
%%%
<p>
The preliminary program for PSA2012 is available at the <a href="[PREFIX]meetings/psa2012/index.html">PSA2012 page</a>. 
With 119 contributed papers and 109 symposium papers arranged over 57 
sessions, PSA2012 is 15% larger than PSA2010 in Montreal. And PSA2010 
attendees will be happy to know we've secured larger rooms for PSA 
sessions at PSA2012. So we have more papers, and more space in which to 
hear them. And of course, the papers slated for PSA2012 cover a wide 
range of topics in the field, in keeping with the PSA's mission of 
promoting research, teaching, and free discussion of issues in the 
philosophy of science from diverse standpoints. For the program's 
evident promise of exceptional quality we owe thanks to labors of the 
PSA2012 Program Committee, chaired by Andrea Woody.
