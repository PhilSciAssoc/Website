%%%
<p>
Early registration for PSA2012, the Twenty-Third Biennial Meeting of the 
Philosophy of Science Association (Nov 15â€“17, 2012 in San Diego, 
California), is now available at <a href="https://hssweb.org/account/?next=/callforpapers/register" rel="external">https://hssweb.org/account/?next=/callforpapers/register</a>. 
Everyone attending PSA2012 is required to register for the conference;
registrants have access to both the PSA and HSS meetings. Prospective 
registrants may log in to their respective accounts using the email and 
password used for previous PSA or HSS meetings or, alternatively, one 
may create a new account; this only takes a few minutes. Please do not 
hesitate to contact Gary Hardcastle (<a href="mailto:ghardcas@bloomu.edu" rel="email">ghardcas@bloomu.edu</a>) 
or Greg Macklem of the HSS (<a href="mailto:greg@hssonline.org" rel="email">greg@hssonline.org</a>) 
should you encounter any problems registering for PSA2012.
</p>
<p>
A draft program for PSA2012 will be distributed, and made available on 
the PSA website, by Wednesday, August 22.

Room reservations at the conference hotel, the Sheraton San Diego Hotel 
&amp; Marina, may be made online at <a href="https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/StarGroupsWeb/booking/reservation?id=1207235409&amp;key=E336C" rel="external">https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/StarGroupsWeb/booking/reservation?id=1207235409&amp;key=E336C</a>. 
To receive the conference rate, rooms must be reserved no later than 14 
October 2012.
</p>
<p>
In addition, a block of hotel rooms will be reserved for PSA graduate 
students at a reduced rate of approximately $112/night ($99/night plus 
taxes of approximately $13). Graduate students wishing to reserve a room 
at the reduced rate should contact Greg Macklem at <a href="mailto:info@hssonline.org" rel="email">info@hssonline.org</a>. 
These rooms will be available to graduate students through 31 August, 
2012.

<p>
Should you locate a room at the Sheraton San Diego during the conference 
for less than the conference rate, please let Gary Hardcastle (<a href="mailto:ghardcas@bloomu.edu" rel="email">ghardcas@bloomu.edu</a>) 
or Greg Macklem (<a href="mailto:greg@hssonline.org" rel="email">greg@hssonline.org</a>) 
know as soon as possible, as it is important that we keep track of how 
many PSA and HSS registrants stay at the conference hotel.
