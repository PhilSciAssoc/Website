PSA2010 Symposium Papers Reminder
%%%
<p>
2010 PSA Symposium Participants are reminded symposium papers must be 
submitted by February 24, 2012, to be considered for publication in a 
supplementary volume of <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>, due out in 
December 2012. 
</p>
<p>
Please be reminded that <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> will publish 
a collection of original papers derived from symposium sessions at PSA2010. 
Papers published elsewhere, or containing work published elsewhere, will 
not be accepted for publication. No papers from author meets critics 
sessions will be considered for publication (following a decision by the 
PSA Governing Board). If an author has a contributed paper from PSA2010 
accepted to be published in the contributed papers volume of 
<cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> for PSA2010, she or he may not submit 
a paper to the symposium volume. Individual papers from symposium 
sessions may be submitted. If, for example, one participant presented 
work that has subsequently been published but others presented original 
work that has not yet been published, the latter may submit their papers 
to <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>.

All submissions must go through Editorial Manager at <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>: 
<a href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/phos/" rel="external">http://www.editorialmanager.com/phos/</a>.  
Make sure that you select the 2010 PSA Symposium Papers option from the 
pull down menu at <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> on Editorial Manager. 
The system is also set up to accept proposals for 2012 Symposia, do not 
submit your papers there. All submissions will be refereed. Make 
reasonable efforts to blind your papers but the editor and referees 
understand that this work has already been presented, in most cases with 
the same title, so complete blinding is not always practicable.
</p>
<p>
There is a hard upper word limit of 5000 words, including notes and 
references, on all published papers. University of Chicago Press 
allocates a certain number of pages to supplementary volumes and editors 
have to strictly enforce word limits.

I hope that I have given you sufficient information to work with. If you 
have questions about the process, please contact me via email:

I look forward to your submissions.
