<p>
The London School of Economics and Political Science announces that this 
year's Lakatos Award, of &pound;10,000 for an outstanding contribution 
to the philosophy of science, goes to: Peter Godfrey-Smith (Harvard 
University), for his book Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection 
(Oxford University Press, 2009). He will visit LSE to receive the Award 
and give the Award Public Lecture during summer term, 2011. The book 
develops a new analysis and extension of Darwin's idea of natural 
selection â€“ one that draws on new developments in philosophy of science, 
biology and other fields. The central concept involved is that of a 
"Darwinian population," a collection of things with the capacity to 
undergo change by natural selection. From this starting point, new 
analyses of the role of genes in evolution, the application of Darwinian 
ideas to cultural change, and "evolutionary transitions" that produce 
complex organisms and societies are developed.

The Lakatos Award is given for an outstanding contribution to the 
philosophy of science, widely interpreted, in the form of a book 
published in English during the previous five years. It was made 
possible by a generous endowment from the Latsis Foundation. The Award 
is in memory of the former LSE professor, Imre Lakatos, and is 
administered by an international Management Committee organised from the 
LSE. The Committee, chaired by John Worrall, decides the outcome of the 
Award competition on the advice of an international, independent and 
anonymous panel of Selectors.
