Results of 2010 PSA Election
%%%
<p>
On behalf of the Governing Board of the Philosophy of Science 
Association, it is my pleasure to announce the results of the 2010 PSA 
election.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Helen Longino</strong> of Stanford University has been elected 
President of the PSA. Professor Longino will serve a two-year term 
(from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012) as Vice-President of 
the PSA, after which she will serve a two-year term (January 1, 2013 
through December 31, 2014) as President of the Association, delivering 
the PSA Presidential Address at PSA2014 in San Diego, California.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Robert Batterman</strong> of the University of Pittsburgh, 
<strong>John Dupr&eacute;</strong> of the University of Exeter, 
<strong>Alan Richardson</strong> of the University of British Columbia, 
and <strong>Miriam Solomon</strong> of Temple University have been 
elected to the Governing Board for the PSA. In order to facilitate the 
transition to single four-year terms for members of the Governing Board, 
the PSA Governing Board voted at its 2010 Annual Meeting to ask Roberta 
Millstein and Stephan Hartmann to serve through the end of 2013. The 
Governing Board also voted to select (either as volunteers or, in the 
event there were no volunteers, randomly) two of those Governing Board 
members elected in the 2010 PSA Election to serve two rather than 
four-year terms as members of the PSA Governing Board, with the option 
to run again for PSA Governing Board in the 2012 PSA Election for a full 
four-year term. Alan Richardson and Robert Batterman volunteered to 
serve two-year, rather than a four-year, terms.

Consequently the PSA Governing Board is presently comprised of:

<p>
The Officers of the PSA congratulate and welcome Professor Longino on 
her election to the Presidency of the PSA, and congratulate and welcome 
Professors Batterman, Dupr&eacute;, Richardson, and Solomon to the PSA 
Governing Board! The Officers also offer deep appreciation and thanks to 
John Norton (University of Pittsburgh), Sandra Mitchell (University of 
Pittsburgh), Heather Douglas (University of Tennessee), and P. Kyle 
Stanford (University of California--Irvine), all of whom are stepping 
down from the Board after serving two consecutive two-year terms. Last 
and hardly least the Officers of the PSA thank the PSA Nominating 
Committee, comprised of C. Kenneth Waters (University of Minnesota), 
Alison Wylie (University of Washington), and, as chair, Margaret 
Morrison (University of Toronto), for assembling a stellar ballot.
</p>
<p>
I am happy to report that of the 687 Full Members of the PSA eligible to 
vote at the election's start, 281, nearly 41%, voted electronically in 
response to email solicitations.  This was the highest turn-out in the 
past three years, i.e., since records have been kept.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I thank those many Full PSA members took the time to vote in 
this election. Once again, the PSA Election ran smoothly due in large 
part to the experience and dedication of Jay Malone and his staff at the 
History of Science Society, especially Greg Macklem. If you are a Full 
Member of the PSA and you encountered problems in voting electronically, 
though, or if you have any other comments, questions, or concerns about 
the 2010 PSA Election, please contact me at

Sincerely,<br />
