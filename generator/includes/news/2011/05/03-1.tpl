Nancy Nersessian, Regents' Professor and Professor of Cognitive Science 
at the Georgia Institute of Technology and member of the Governing Board 
of Philosophy of Science Association, has been named by the American 
Philosophical Society as the first recipient of its Patrick Suppes Prize 
in Philosophy of Science for her book <cite>Creating Scientific Concepts</cite> 
(MIT Press, 2008). The prize carries a $10,000 stipend.

<p>
Dr. Nersessian's research focuses on creativity, innovation, and 
conceptual change in science. To this end, she works to bring together 
methodologies and conceptual frameworks from cognitive science, 
philosophy of science, and history of science, exploring both the 
cognitive and cultural mechanisms that lead to scientific innovation.

In her first book <cite>Faraday to Einstein: Constructing Meaning in 
Scientific Theories</cite> (Kluwer Press, 1984/1990), Dr. Nersessian 
emphasized the need for a better way to talk about the meaning of 
scientific concepts but did not introduce systematic ideas from 
cognitive science and developmental psychology to understand scientific 
change. This she has done in <cite>Creating Scientific Concepts</cite>. 
Her analysis of Maxwell's complicated departure from a mechanical 
conception of electromagnetic phenomena and the discovery of his 
fundamental electromagnetic equations was described by the American 
Philosophical Association as "probably the best work of this kind to be 
found in the recent literature." Dr. Nersessian's work in this field 
draws from an incredible array of sources, from concepts and analyses in 
cognitive science to the extensive body of literature on scientific 
practices available in the social science field, and from her own 
theoretical analyses of problems to historical documents and interviews 
with scholars.

The Patrick Suppes Prize was established and funded five years ago by 
Patrick Suppes, the Lucie Stern Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at 
Stanford University and long-standing member of the American 
Philosophical Society. The prize will be awarded annually, recognizing 
one of three areas -- philosophy with special consideration for the 
philosophy of science, psychology, and the history of science -- every 
third year. The selection of the inaugural recipient of the Patrick 
Suppes Prize was made by Pat Suppes, in consultation with Jordi Cat 
(Indiana University), Thomas Ryckman (Stanford University), Michael 
Friedman (Stanford University), Helen Longino (Stanford University), 
George Smith (Tufts University), and Nancy Cartwright (University of 
California—San Diego/London School of Economics).
