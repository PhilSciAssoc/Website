New Journal Announcement: The Journal of Causal Inference
%%%
<p>
We are pleased to announce the launch of the Journal of Causal Inference, a new
journal dedicated to building a rigorous cross-disciplinary dialogue in
causality.
</p>
<p>
Existing discipline-specific journals tend to bury causal analysis in the
language and methods of traditional statistical methodologies, creating the
inaccurate impression that causal questions can be handled by routine methods of
regression or simultaneous equations and glossing over the special precautions
demanded by causal analysis. In contrast, Journal of Causal Inference highlights
both the uniqueness and interdisciplinary nature of causal research. The journal
serves as a forum for the growing causal inference community to develop a shared
language and to study the commonalities and distinct strengths of their various
disciplinesâ€š methods for causal analysis.
