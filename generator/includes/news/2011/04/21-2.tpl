<p>
With no other current publication addressing the history of philosophy 
of science, the <cite>HOPOS</cite> journal will have its own place in a 
growing area of research. 
</p>
<p>
The journal situates understanding of individual sciences within their 
historical settings and against the backdrop of mainstream issues in 
philosophical thought relevant to the growth of our knowledge of the 
world and of human nature. 
</p>
<p>
"Our aim is a journal that provides an outlet for interdisciplinary work 
that is not often easy to publish in existing journals," said Rose-Mary 
Sargent of Merrimack College who will serve as the journal's first 
editor. "Both subject matter and length restrictions in existing 
journals do not allow for the extensive bibliographical references so 
often required in works that are of both a philosophical and a 
historical nature. <cite>HOPOS</cite> provides an important new venue 
for this kind of scholarship."
</p>
<p>
The journal is available in both print and electronic formats. Each 
issue will contain a minimum of four articles and 10 to 15 book reviews.
 Articles are blind reviewed by two or three referees.
</p>
<p>
The first issue is dedicated to the memory of Ernan McMullin, one of the 
founders of the discipline who died unexpectedly while the issue was in 
press.
