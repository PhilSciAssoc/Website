The John J. Reilly Center for Science, Technology, and Values, along 
with the Graduate Program in History and Philosophy of Science at the 
University of Notre Dame and the Advisory Committee of the James T. 
Cushing Memorial Prize in History and Philosophy of Physics are pleased 
to announce the award of the Cushing Prize for 2011 to Dr. Charlotte 
Werndl, Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Philosophy, 
Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics.  She is 
being honored for her paper, "What Are the New Implications of Chaos for 
Unpredictability?" published in The British Journal for the Philosophy 
of Science in 2009. The Cushing Prize carries a $1000 award plus an 
invitation to deliver a lecture as part of the History and Philosophy of 
Science Colloquium at the University of Notre Dame.

Charlotte summarizes her argument in the abstract of her paper: "one 
might expect that the question 'What are the new implications of chaos 
for unpredictability?' has already been answered in a satisfactory way. 
However, this is not the case&hellip; I will approach this question by 
showing that chaos can be defined via mixing, which has never before 
been explicitly argued for. Based on this insight, I will propose that 
the sought-after new implication of chaos for unpredictability is the 
following: for predicting any event, all sufficiently past events are 
approximately probabilistically irrelevant."

Charlotte was nominated for the Prize by senior colleagues at LSE, who 
describe the importance of her paper for the philosophy of physics in 
this way: "Chaos theory has often been hailed as the third revolution in 
physics in the 20th Century&hellip; From the beginning of chaos research 
until today, the unpredictability of chaos has been a central theme. 
However, it has long been unclear how exactly chaos impinges on our 
understanding of unpredictability.  In particular, the question whether 
chaotic systems show a special kind of unpredictability, i.e. whether 
they are unpredictable in a way that other deterministic (or indeed 
indeterministic) systems are not, has not been answered satisfactorily 
for decades. The paper contains a lucid discussion of how to define 
chaos in a mathematically rigorous say. More specifically, it argues 
that chaos can be defined in terms of the mathematical notion of mixing. 
Based on this definition, she is able to clarify whether chaotic systems 
show a special kind of unpredictability&hellip; In this way she solved a 
profound problem which had plagued physicists and philosophers for 
decades."

Charlotte earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 2003 as well as 
Master's degrees in both Mathematics and Philosophy in 2006 from the 
University of Salzburg and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of 
Cambridge in 2009.  She was a Junior Research Fellow in The Queen's 
College and Faculty of Philosophy at Oxford University during 2009-10.
