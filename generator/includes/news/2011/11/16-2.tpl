2012 Cushing Memorial Prize -- Call for Nominations
%%%
<p>
The family, students, friends, and colleagues of Jim Cushing are pleased once 
again to solicit nominations for the <strong>James T. Cushing Prize in the History and 
Philosophy of Physics.</strong> In recognition of Jim’s well-known role as a nurturer 
of new talent in the profession, this annual prize is intended to recognize and 
reward the work of younger scholars. The next winner will receive $1,000 and an 
invitation to deliver a paper in the University of Notre Dame's History and 
Philosophy of Science Colloquium series during the 2012-2013 academic year.
</p>
<p>
Work is eligible by nomination only. Eligible are all papers in the history and 
philosophy of physics published by a younger scholar within the three years prior 
to the current call for nominations (i.e., published no earlier than October 2008). 
Without defining "younger scholar," our intention is to favor work produced by 
scholars who are no more than five years or so beyond completion of the Ph.D. or, 
in a comparable way, new to the fields of the history and philosophy of physics.

Nominated work will be evaluated by a committee drawn from the members of the

A nomination should consist of a brief description of the 
significance of the nominated work and such information about the author as the 
nominator might think helpful to the evaluation committee (e.g., an abbreviated 
c.v.). <strong>The deadline for receipt of nominations is 15 March 2012</strong>.  
The winner will be announced in May 2012.
