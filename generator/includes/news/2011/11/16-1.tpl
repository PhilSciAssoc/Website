Lakatos Award 2011

<p>
The London School of Economics and Political Science announces that the Lakatos
Award, of &pound;10,000 for an outstanding contribution to the philosophy of 
science, will not be awarded in 2011.
</p>
<p>
The Management Committee for the Lakatos Award has considered the reports from 
the Selectors on the books shortlisted for the 2011 prize. While there is no 
doubt that all of the shortlisted books have their virtues, and that some make 
weighty contributions to the field, the overall view taken by the Management 
Committee on the basis of the Selectors' reports is that none quite meets the 
level of impact and significance required to merit the Award; and consequently 
no Award will be made this year.

The Lakatos Award is given for an outstanding contribution to the philosophy of 
science, widely interpreted, in the form of a book published in English during 
the previous five years.  It was made possible by a generous endowment from the 
Latsis Foundation.  The Award is in memory of the former LSE professor, Imre 
Lakatos, and is administered by an international Management Committee organised 
from the LSE.
</p>
<p>
The Committee, chaired by John Worrall, decides the outcome of the Award 
competition on the advice of an international, independent and anonymous panel 
of Selectors. 
</p>
<p>
Nominations can now be made for the 2012 Lakatos Award, and must be received by 
Friday 20th April 2012. The 2012 Award will be for a book published in English with 
an imprint from 2007-2012 inclusive. A book may, with the permission of the author, 
be nominated by any person of recognised standing within the profession.

Imre Lakatos, who died in 1974 aged 51, had been Professor of Logic with special 
reference to the Philosophy of Mathematics at LSE since 1969. He joined the 
Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method in 1960.  Born in Hungary in 
1922, he graduated (in Physics, Mathematics and Philosophy) from Debrecen University 
in 1944.  He then joined the underground resistance.  (His mother and grandmother 
perished in Auschwitz.)  After the War, he was active in the Communist Party and had 
an influential position in the Ministry of Education.  In 1950 he was arrested and 
spent the next three years as a political prisoner.  After his release, he was given 
refuge in the Hungarian Academy of Science where he translated western works in 
science and mathematics into Hungarian.  After the suppression of the Hungarian 
uprising he escaped to Vienna and from there, with the aid of a Rockefeller fellowship, 
on to Cambridge, England.  He there wrote his (second) doctoral thesis out of which 
grew his famous Proofs and Refutations (Cambridge University Press, 1976). Two volumes 
of Philosophical Papers, edited by John Worrall and Gregory Currie, appeared in 1978, 
also from Cambridge University Press.
