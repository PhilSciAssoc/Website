Since 1934, the Philosophy of Science Association has promoted research, 
teaching, and the free discussion of issues in the philosophy of 
science, becoming in the process the world's premier academic 
association for scholars of science. Today the PSA's mission has never 
been more significant, or exciting. In the coming decades the PSA will 
increase its efforts, promoting new research, advancing the teaching of 
philosophy of science, and placing the discipline firmly within the 
global discussion of science in the 21st century.

<p>
The PSA's mission is formidable, and its achievement requires support 
from all scholars of science. I encourage you to consider supporting the 
PSA with your donation!
