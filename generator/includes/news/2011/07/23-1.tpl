"During the time Josh was a PhD student in our department, I came to see 
that he was by far the most philosophically talented student we had. He 
had already started giving talks at excellent conferences, including a 
talk on probability at the Philosophy of Science Association -- his 
first submitted paper was to be published in Philosophy of Science. I 
have no doubt he would've turned out to be a fantastic philosopher. More 
importantly, he was a good person." Rob Skipper, Associate Professor and 
Head of the Department of Philosophy University of Cincinnati.
