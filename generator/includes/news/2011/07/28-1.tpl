<p>
This archive contains a collection of scanned original documents and 
audio recordings related to Hugh Everett III (November 11, 1930 - July 
19, 1982), the American physicist who first proposed what has come to be 
known as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

These documents include draft and final versions of Everett's long and 
short Ph.D. theses and the early notes that led to these published works, 
Everett's correspondence regarding his relative state formulation of 
pure wave mechanics, and miscellaneous biographical material. Most of 
these documents were discovered in the basement of Mark Everett, Hugh 
Everett III's son in 2007. This collection was edited by Jeffrey A. 
Barrett, Peter Byrne, and James O. Weatherall and was supported in part 
by UC Irvine Libraries and by NSF grant No. SES-0924135.

Biographical and conceptual essays, detailed notes and commentary, and 
definitive versions of the most important documents in this collection 
can be found in: Jeffrey A. Barrett and Peter Byrne (eds) The Everett 
Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Collected Works 1955 - 1980 with 
Commentary, Princeton University Press (forthcoming 2011).
