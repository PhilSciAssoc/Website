%%%
<p>
Members of the Philosophy of Science Association should recently have received
the April 2009 (Volume 76, no. 2) issue of the Association's journal,
<cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>.
</p>
<p>
I'm very pleased to inform you that according to its current projected production
schedule <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> will be on schedule by March of 2010.
This means that we anticipate the delivery of five issues of <cite>Philosophy of Science</cite>
in the next three months, as follows:
</p>
<ul class="bullets bold">
<li><cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> July 2009 (v76n3): January 15, 2010</li>
<li><cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> Oct 2009 (v76n4): January 31, 2010</li>
<li><cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> Dec 2009 (v76n5): February 14, 2010</li>
<li><cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> January 2010 (v77n1): February 28, 2010</li>
<li><cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> April 2010 (v77n2): March 22, 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>
2010 will thus begin with quite a serving of very high quality philosophy of
science!  For this we thank the journal's Editor-in-Chief, Jeffrey Barrett, its
Managing Editor, Tucker Lentz, and the journal's Associate Editors and Editorial
Board, all of whom have worked very hard to bring the journal back up to
schedule.  I'm also happy to report that the Editorial Office for
<cite>Philosophy of Science</cite> has been offering very prompt first responses
to submitted manuscripts, typically within six weeks of submission.
