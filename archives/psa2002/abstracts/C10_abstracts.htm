<h2><a name="53"></a><b>&quot;Are Our Best Physical Theories (Probably and/or
Approximately) True?&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Computer1/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/PSA2002/program_authors.htm#Barrett">Jeffrey

<p>There is good reason to suppose that our best physical theories are false.
Moreover, I will argue, we quite literally have no idea what it might mean to
claim that they are approximately true. Nonetheless, the belief that our best
current physical theories will prove to be similar to our best future physical
theories plays an important role in inquiry.</p>

<h2><a name="138"></a><b>&quot;Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking: Its Meaning From a
Simple Classical Model&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Computer1/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/PSA2002/program_authors.htm#Liu">Chuang

<p>This paper aims at answering the simple question `what is spontaneous
symmetry breaking (SSB)?` by analyzing from a philosophical perspective a simple
classical model which exhibits all the requisite properties of SSB. Related
questions include: what does it mean to say that a symmetry is spontaneously
broken? Is it broken without any cause, or is the symmetry not broken but merely
hidden? Is the meta-principle, `no asymmetry in, no asymmetry out,` violated by
SSB? And what is the role in this of random perturbations (or fluctuations)?</p>

<h2><a name="137"></a><b>&quot;The Applicability of Shannon Information in
Quantum Mechanics and Zeilinger`s Foundational Principle&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Computer1/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/PSA2002/program_authors.htm#Timpson">C.
G. Timpson</a> (The Queen`s College, Oxford)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/11/00/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>Recently, Brukner and Zeilinger have presented a number of arguments
suggesting that the Shannon information is not well defined as a measure of
information in quantum mechanics. If established, this result would be highly
significant, as the Shannon information is fundamental to the way we think about
information not only in classical but also in quantum information theory. On
consideration, however, these arguments are found unsuccessful; I go on to
suggest how they might be arising as a consequence of Zeilinger`s proposed
foundational principle for quantum mechanics.</p>

Demon&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Computer1/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/PSA2002/program_authors.htm#Weinstein">Steven

<p>This paper examines some common measures of complexity, structure, and
information, with an eye toward understanding the extent to which complexity or
information-content may be regarded as objective properties of individual
objects. A form of contextual objectivity is proposed which renders the measures
objective, and which largely resolves the puzzle of Maxwell`s Demon.</p>
