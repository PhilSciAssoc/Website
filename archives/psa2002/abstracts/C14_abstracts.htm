<h2><a name="114"></a><b>&quot;Field Unification in the Maxwell-Lorentz Theory
with Absolute Space&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Rynasiewicz">Robert

<p> Although Trautman (1966) appears to give a unified-field treatment
of electrodynamics in Newtonian spacetime, there are difficulties in cogently
interpreting it as such in relation to the facts of electromagnetic and
magneto-electric induction. Presented here is a covariant, non-unified field
treatment of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory with absolute space. This dispels a
worry in Earman (1989) as to whether there are any historically realistic
examples in which absolute space plays an indispenable role. It also shows how
Trautman`s formulation can be rendered coherent, albeit at the cost of
de-unification, by reinterpreting the Maxwell tensor as a composite object
involving, in part, elements from Newtonian spacetime.</p>

<p>Einstein algebras have been suggested (Earman 1989) and rejected (Rynasiewicz
1992) as a way to avoid the hole argument against spacetime substantivalism. In
this article, I debate their merits and faults. In particular, I suggest that a
gauge-invariant interpretation of Einstein algebras that avoids the hole
argument can be associated with one approach to quantizing gravity, and, for
this reason, is at least as well motivated as sophisticated substantivalist and
relationalist interpretations of the standard tensor formalism.</p>

<p>Understanding the Time-Asymmetry of Radiation Abstract In our experience,
waves display a clear time-asymmetry: waves spread outwards after their sources
move; they do not converge on sources in coordination with their motion. The
laws governing wave phenomena, however, are symmetric in time. Where does the
observed asymmetry come from? I discuss the nature of this puzzle and argue that
its most common formulation is flawed. I consider a recent proposal due to
Mathias Frisch. I argue that Frisch misconceives the puzzle and consequently
misunderstands what his own solution amounts to. Finally, I suggest that the
asymmetry of radiation results from the initial state of the universe.</p>

<h2><a name="101"></a><b>&quot;Time Travel and Consistency Constraints&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="../program_authors.htm#Kutach">Douglas
Kutach</a>  (Texas Tech University)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/10/81/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full
text]</font></a></h2>
<p>The possibility of time travel, as permitted in General Relativity, is
responsible for constraining physical fields beyond what the laws normally
require. In the special case where time travel is limited to a single object
returning to the past and interacting with itself, consistency constraints can
be avoided if the dynamics is continuous and the object’s state space
satisfies a certain topological requirement: that all null-homotopic mappings
from the state-space to itself have some fixed point. Where consistency
constraints do exist, no new physics is needed to enforce them. All one needs
for their accommodation is to grant a kind of law-like status to some kinds of
global boundary conditions.</p>
