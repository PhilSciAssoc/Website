<h1 align="left"><a name="11"></a><i>Biological Kinds and Human Kinds</i>
(Symposium)</h1>
<p>The 1990s saw two prominent proposals for the biological basis of human
nature. Some proponents of the Human Genome Project suggested that human nature
lies in our unique gene sequence. Evolutionary psychologists argued that human
nature lies in a set of mental modules selected in our evolutionary past. These
approaches to human nature have been widely criticised. One objection is that
such approaches inappropriately adopt genetic determinism. Another objection is
that such approaches rely on outdated assumptions in biological taxonomy, namely
essentialism and typological thinking. There are many other criticisms.</p>
<p>The aim of this session is not to further criticise such accounts of human
nature but to develop positive alternatives. Many philosophers and scientists
assume that knowledge of our biology is important for understanding human
nature. The question is how to construct a biological approach to human nature?
Recent literature on biological kinds and human kinds suggests a path. That
literature contains two overlapping approaches. One approach is found in Ian
Hacking's work on human kinds. Human kinds are different than standard natural
kinds; their etiology is both biological and sociological. The other approach to
human kinds comes from evolutionary developmental theory. The etiologies of
individual humans and human kinds are the result of our genes, environments, and
cultures. These two approaches suggest a more robust account of the biological
basis of human nature. Developmental and cultural factors, as well as genes, are
seen as important components of our natures. Phylogeny weaves those different
components together. This account of humans avoids the pitfalls of previous
biological approaches, and it offers a richer explanatory framework for human
nature. The assumption that there is a human essence is replaced with the idea
that there is an evolving variety of humans. The purpose of this symposium,
then, is to explore such an account of human nature and human kinds.</p>

<p>We constantly assign humans to different categories, just as we have
elaborate systems for the classification of animals. There are some major
differences between these practices, one of which is that in biology we have a
need for a general system of classification. In the human case this is neither
needed nor desirable. My talk will explore the consequences of this and other
differences as part of a general project of exploring the heterogeneity of
kinds.</p>

<p>I have argued elsewhere that emotions are not a natural kind, and that the
same is probably true of many specific emotion categories, such as anger and
love. Many philosophers of emotion remain unconvinced. Many suppose that my
position can be refuted by giving any reasonably clear analysis of vernacular
concept of emotion. But the claim that emotion is not a natural kind is entirely
consistent with the fact that a systematic account can be given of the
vernacular concept. The question at issue is whether that vernacular category is
a productive object of scientific enquiry. Other critics have been concerned to
show that the category of emotion has a valuable role in normative practices
such as self-criticism, and have suggested that the concept is thereby insulated
from revision of intension and extension as a result of empirical inquiry. This
critique raises important issues about the relationship between scientific and
vernacular discourse about the mind, issues which I attempt to address here.</p>

<p>Many writers claim that human kinds are significantly different from
biological and natural kinds.&nbsp; Some suggest that humans kinds are unique
because social structures are essential for the etiology of human kinds.&nbsp;
Others argue that human cultural evolution is a decidedly different form of
evolution.&nbsp; In this paper I suggest that the gulf between humans and our
biological relatives is not as wide as some argue.&nbsp; There is a taxonomic
difference between human and non human organisms, but such factors as social
structure and cultural evolution do not distinguish us from many other
organisms.&nbsp;<br>
