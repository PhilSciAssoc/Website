<p> Reverse engineering is a matter of inferring adaptive function from
structure. The utility of reverse engineering for evolutionary biology has been
a matter of controversy. I offer a simple taxonomy of the uses of engineering
design in assessing adaptation, with a variety of illustrations. The
plausibility of applications of engineering design reflects the specific way the
models are elaborated and derived.</p>

<p>Recent years have seen increased interest in the question of whether it is
possible to provide an evolutionary game theoretic explanation for certain kinds
of social norms. These explanatory approaches often rely on the fact that, in
certain evolutionary models, the basin of attraction of &quot;fair&quot; or
&quot;just&quot; strategies occupies a certain percentage of the state space. I
sketch a proof of a general representation theorem for a large class of
evolutionary game theoretic models played on a social network, in the hope that
this will contribute to a greater understanding of the basins of attraction of
such models -- and hence the evolution of social norms. More precisely, I show
how many kinds of social networks can be translated into random boolean
networks. The interesting and useful part of this result is that, for many
social networks, one can find a bijection f between the state space of the
social network and the state space of the random boolean network, such that the
state S` follows the state S under the dynamical laws of the social network
if and only if f(S`) follows the state f(S) under the dynamics of the random
boolean network. In some cases, it is not possible to find such a bijection; in
these cases, one can find an injection f with the property that if S`
follows S under the dynamics of the social network, then f(S`) follows f(S)
under the dynamics of the random boolean network. I then use this method to
catalog all the basins of attraction for some simple two-strategy games (the
prisoner`s dilemma and the stag hunt) played on a ring, drawing on the work of
Wuensche and Lesser (1992).</p>

<h2><a name="78"></a><b>&quot;Species Pluralism Does Not Imply Species
Eliminativism&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Computer1/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/PSA2002/program_authors.htm#Brigandt">Ingo

<p>Marc Ereshefsky argues that pluralism about species suggests that the species
concept is not theoretically useful. It is to be abandoned in favor of several
concrete species concepts that denote real categories. While accepting species
pluralism, the present paper rejects eliminativism about the species category.
It is argued that the species concept is important and that it is possible to
make sense of a general species concept despite the existence of different
concrete species concepts.</p>

<h2><a name="146"></a><b>&quot;Interpretations of Probability in Evolutionary
Theory&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="/C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Computer1/My%20Documents/My%20Webs/PSA2002/program_authors.htm#Millstein">Roberta

<p>Evolutionary theory (ET) is teeming with probabilities. Probabilities exist
at all levels: the level of mutation, the level of microevolution, and the level
of macroevolution. This uncontroversial claim raises a number of contentious
issues. For example, is the evolutionary process (as opposed to the theory)
indeterministic, or is it deterministic? Philosophers of biology have taken
different sides on this issue. Millstein (1997) has argued that we are not
currently able answer this question, and that even scientific realists ought to
remain agnostic concerning the determinism or indeterminism of evolutionary
processes. If this argument is correct, it suggests that, whatever we take
probabilities in ET to be, they must be consistent with either determinism or
indeterminism. This raises some interesting philosophical questions: How should
we understand the probabilities used in ET? In other words, what is meant by
saying that a certain evolutionary change is more or less probable? Which
interpretation of probability is the most appropriate for ET? I argue that the
probabilities used in ET are objective in a realist sense, if not in an
indeterministic sense. Furthermore, there are a number of interpretations of
probability that are objective and would be consistent with ET under determinism
or indeterminism. However, I argue that evolutionary probabilities are best
understood as propensities of population-level kinds.</p>
