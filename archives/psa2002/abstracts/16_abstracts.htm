<h1 align="left"><a name="16"></a><i>The Pragmatics of Scientific Representation</i>
(Symposium)</h1>
<p>Scientific representation is a central notion in the philosophy of science.
It is the key to almost every variety of the realism / antirealism debate; it
plays an important role in discussions of explanation; it affects the debates
over the nature of laws, time, space and causation; and it is central to
philosophical reflection on scientific modelling and theorising in general.</p>
<p>Philosophical reflection on the practice of scientific modeling has been
experiencing a strong revival in recent times. A primary function of scientific
models is often that of representing the world and our interactions with it. It
is therefore surprising that the notion of representation itself has received
relatively little philosophical attention. This symposium will approach
representation through the practice of scientific model-building. It will
concentrate on the specific question: &quot;How do models represent?&quot; The
answers rehearsed in the symposium will emphasise the essentially pragmatic
nature of scientific representation, and will display some of the consequences
of the motto: &quot;nothing is a representation unless it is used as such (by
someone, somewhere)&quot;. Thus, a presupposition of the symposium will be that
reductivist and dyadic accounts of representation are unfit for science. These
are accounts that want to reduce representation to truth, or to similarity, or
to structural identity, or to any other dyadic relation between the
representation and the represented, by ignoring the specific purposes for which
scientists employ representations in the practice of science.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the symposium papers will address two different types of issues.
First, there will be philosophical analyses of pragmatist and intentional
accounts of representation. Second, there will be historical case studies
designed to illustrate the representational function of models in practice. Most
papers in the symposium will do a bit of both.</p>

<p>What are models that they may be used to represent reality?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Answer: Models are objects that can be used to represent reality by
exhibiting a designated similarity to physical objects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Similarity is often criticized because anything may be similar to
anything else and because there is no satisfactory general characterization of
similarity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I exploit these facts by
insisting that claims of similarity between models and real objects must be
accompanied by specifications of the respects and the degrees to which
similarity is claimed, specifications that can only be supplied by those using
the model according to their own interests.<span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p>

<p>Modelling became one of the primary tools of economic research in the 20th
century and economists understand their mathematical models as giving some kind
of representation of the economic world, one adequate enough to their purpose of
reasoning about that world. But when we look at examples of how non-analogical
models were first built in economics, both the process of making representations
and aspects of the representing relation remain opaque. Like early astronomers,
economists have to imagine how the hidden parts of their world are arranged and
to make images, that is, create models, to represent how they work. The case of
the Edgeworth Box, a widely used model in 20th century economics, provides a
good example to explore the role of imagination and images in the process of
making representations of the economy.</p>

Representation&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Suárez">Mauricio

<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">I defend a deflationary conception of scientific representation, which
minimally characterises it by means of two necessary conditions: representation
is essentially intentional and it has the capacity to allow surrogate reasoning
and inference. I then defend this conception by showing that it successfully
meets the objections and difficulties that make its competitors, such as
isomorphism and similarity, untenable. In addition the inferential conception
explains the success of various means of representation in their appropriate
domains, and it sheds light on the truth and accuracy of scientific
representations.<o:p>

<h2><a name="16E"></a><b>&quot;Telltale Signs: What Attention to Representation
Reveals about Scientific Explanation&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Woody">Andrea
Woody</a> (University of Washington)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This essay explores the connection between representation and scientific
explanation. An &quot;inferential&quot; conception of representation is
outlined. This framework is used to examine the role of some graphical
techniques in elementary chemistry, emphasizing the inferential strengths
afforded by the graphical format. I argue how recognition of these inferential
capacities should have consequences for our understanding of the nature and role
of explanation in this discipline - and quasi-inductively, for scientific
disciplines more generally. The view endorsed makes natural connection with
unificationist accounts of explanation. It also provides a rationale for why
&quot;explanatory power&quot; typically is considered an epistemic virtue.</p>

Non-representational&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Van Fraassen">Bas

<p>Science represents the phenomena, and it does so by providing representations
of nature as a whole. Criteria of adequacy for a representation pertain to
accuracy and truth; but that representation is selective and may require
distortion even in the selected parameters is an old and familiar point,
intimately related to the insight that representation is intentional with
adequacy relative to its particular purpose. If we add to this that observation
and measurement are perspectival and that the appearances to be saved are the
perspectival measurement outcomes, the question whether this &quot;saving&quot;
is an <i>explanatory</i> relation in contemporary physics can provide a new
focus for the realist/anti-realist debate.</p>
