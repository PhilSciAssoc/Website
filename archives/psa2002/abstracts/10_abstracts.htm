Honoring His Contributions to the Philosophy of Science</i> (Symposium)</h1>

Salmon made many seminal contributions to the philosophy of science and the work
he has left us constitutes a rich resource for research in many areas. When I
was asked to organize this symposium, Merrilee Salmon suggested that to continue
the spirit of Wes’s progressive philosophical outlook, the symposiasts should
be asked to present papers that provided new insights into various areas in
which Wes had worked, rather than providing a retrospective survey of his
contributions. Because his work covers such a wide area, I have invited
participants who will address three of the topics to which he devoted
considerable attention for most of his career: spacetime, probability and
induction, and causality and explanation. Inevitably, we shall have to neglect
other areas to which Wes made important contributions and there are many other
eminent philosophers of science whom I wish could have been included, but the
speakers and topics chosen should provide an informed and substantive set of
talks that will demonstrate the vitality of Salmon’s contributions to our
discipline.</span></p>

<a href="../program_authors.htm#Dowe">Phil
Dowe</a> (University of Tasmania)&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">In this paper I show how
the conserved quantity theory of Wesley Salmon and myself provides a sufficient
condition in an analysis of causation. To do so I will show how it handles the
problem of misconnections. Take any two causally independent events, say, my
tapping the table and the clock hand moving a moment later. There is no causal
connection between these two particular events, but there is in fact a set of
causal processes and interactions between them, according to the conserved
quantity theory. The reason is that there are air molecules filling the gap
between, so that one can connect the two events by stringing together a series
of molecular collisions. Also there is a longitudinal disturbance, the sound of
my tapping, which reaches the clock hand before it moves. So, again, there can
be a set of causal processes and interactions where there is no causal
connection. I set out the conditions under which a set of processes and
interactions constitute a causal relation.</span></p>

They Good For?&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Hitchcock">Chris
Hitchcock</a> (California Institute of Technology)&nbsp;</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Concerning any object of philosophical analysis,
we can ask the two questions posed in the title of this talk. Despite
difficulties in formulating a precise criterion to distinguish causal processes
from pseudoprocesses, I will argue that Salmon answered the first of these
questions with extraordinary clarity. The second question, by contrast, has not
been successfully answered, by Salmon, or by anybody else. In particular, it is
not clear how causal processes and interactions can be used to solve the problem
of explanatory irrelevance that led Salmon to think about causation in the first
place.</font></p>

<h2><a name="10D"></a><b>&quot;Objective Probabilities: Frequencies and Physical
Chances&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Humphreys">Paul
Humphreys</a> (University of Virginia)&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The
frequency interpretation of probability played a central role in Wes Salmon’s
philosophy of science for most of his career. Although he suggested in his later
work that the propensity account could serve an important function within his
theory of causation, he never rejected his earlier commitments to objectively
homogeneous reference classes as a correct basis for understanding probability.
Yet Wes was famous for having advocated a shift to ontic accounts of causation,
a shift that has consequences reaching far beyond explanation, and this shift
raises the question of how to provide a coherent account of probability that can
support Salmon’s later views on probabilistic causation and explanation, views
that seem more naturally suited to physical probabilities than to frequencies.
In the spirit of the path that Wes’s work has opened, I shall explore the
connections between the propensity and frequency accounts of probability and
suggest that, just as Wes rather startlingly argued that a theory of causation
need be only contingently true of our world, so too can a theory of probability
that accompanies it. I shall also discuss how this shift affects our theories of
inductive inference.<o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">My
talk would be a discussion of the basic structure of theses of conventionalism
(and theses opposed to conventionalism) in spacetime theories. I would be
exploring the way in which basic philosophical assumptions, of an
epistemological nature, interact with the specific contents of particular
spacetime theories in the conventionalist's (and anti-conventionalist's)
arguments.</span>&nbsp;</p>
