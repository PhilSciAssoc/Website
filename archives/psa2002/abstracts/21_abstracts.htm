<h1 align="left"><a name="21"></a><i>Model Construction and Evaluation in the
Computationally Complex Sciences</i> (Symposium)</h1>
<p>Despite philosophers' of science recent interest in models, we do not yet possess a deep understanding of model construction and evaluation in the early stages of theory construction.  One can argue that many of our criteria for evaluating theories and models are still drawn from analyses of comparatively finished science.  These criteria are of questionable use when examining the models that scientists construct as responses to computational or analytical intractability in the equations of a governing theory.  When faced with such intractability, scientists employ a wide variety of approximations, idealizations and physical arguments to produce soluble equations that can be compared to available data.  Due to the difficulty of determining whether the model's success is due to the chance cancellation of factors, the models are provisional only.  Are the models produced worthy of further study?  This is an important scientific question with methodological and philosophical
implications.</p>
<p>The speakers in this symposium examine issues of model construction and evaluation in such situations.  In order to focus they discussion, they examine primarily questions surrounding techniques of parameterization, i.e. the use of experimental values to set values for theoretical variables.  Such techniques go by a number of names including effective field theories, semi-empirical techniques, homology modeling and threading.  The symposiasts will raise a number of methodological and philosophical questions about these techniques.  What criteria have to be satisfied for the strategies to be acceptable?  Are they any better than other forms of modeling?  What role do other models play in order to determine the parameters from experiment?  Are the models constructed with such techniques explanatory?</p>
<p>The speakers will address the use of these techniques in the disciplines of physics, chemistry and biochemistry.  The commentator will respond by extending the discussion into ecology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>	The symposium will expand our discussion of model construction and evaluation into the early stages of theory and model construction.  As a result of the discussion, we should come away with a clearer sense of how to discuss the legitimacy of modifications to theory.  This has important implications for questions about the autonomy of levels of organization, realism vs. instrumentalism, theoretical pluralism, and explanation.  All of these issues will be addressed by the symposiasts.

<p>Ever since the formulation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the early
nineteen seventies, nuclear physicists have been trying to understand the
structure of atomic nuclei in terms of its most fundamental constituents: quarks
and gluons, the constituents of protons, neutrons etc. which in turn constitute
the atomic nucleus. Sadly, straightforward analytical deductions from the theory
turn out to be too complicated. Two alternative strategies are employed: First,
there is an enormous number of phenomenological models which are much easier to
apply but typically lack a convincing theoretical foundation. Besides, it is not
possible to assess the error in such models. Second, there is the currently very
popular methodology of effective field theories which leads to an exact power
series expansion of the Lagrangian density of QCD in terms of expressions with
the correct symmetry properties. From this, in principle all relevant
observables can be calculated, and the error can be estimated.</p>

<p>The paper examines critically some recently published views by Ramsey on the
contrast between ab initio and parametrized theories. Contrary to Ramsey I argue
that, all things being equal, ab initio calculations are regarded more highly in
both physics and chemistry. A case study on so-called first principles
calculations in chemistry, involving wavefunction as well as density functional
approaches, is also presented. The nature of these calculations is discussed in
the context of the question of parametrization.</p>

Construction and Evaluation in the Early Stages of Theory Construction&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Protein folding scientists have long hoped that they would be able to predict
the three dimensional structure of folded proteins from the amino acid sequence
of the protein. However, since each linear sequence has an almost astronomical
number of degrees of freedom, they have been constantly frustrated in their
attempts to do so. To avoid the forbidding computational difficulties, they have
constructed a number of models to study the folding process, yet the models
themselves have provided only partial answers to the problem of folding. This
paper examines one such modeling technique, viz. semi-empirical approaches
employing threading and homology modeling. I provide a methodological analysis
of these approaches, examining how they are constructed and justified. I focus
on the latter, since it is not clear what counts as strong evidence for a model
in the early stages of theory or model construction.</p>
