Bayesian Solution&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Vranas">Peter
B. M. Vranas</a> (Iowa State University)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/06/88/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>According to Hempel`s paradox, evidence (E) that an object is a nonblack
nonraven confirms the hypothesis (H) that every raven is black. According to the
standard Bayesian solution, E does confirm H but only to a minute degree. This
solution relies on the almost never explicitly defended assumption that the
probability of H should not be affected by evidence that an object is nonblack.
I argue that this assumption is implausible, and I propose a way out for the
Bayesians.</p>

<h2><a name="126"></a><b>&quot;Underdetermination and the Problem of Identical
Rivals&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Magnus">P.
D. Magnus</a> (University of California, San Diego)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/10/86/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>This paper explores a connection between underdetermination and the identity
conditions for theories: Must we provide the latter before enquiring into the
former? Quine proposes that we call two theories identical if they are
equivalent under a reconstrual of predicates, but this may mishandle important
cases. Another proposal is to defer to the particular judgements of actual
scientists. Consideration of an historical episode--- the alleged equivalence of
wave and matrix mechanics--- shows that this second proposal also fails.
Nevertheless, I suggest, we may enquire into underdetermination without a better
candidate.</p>

<h2><a name="95"></a><b>&quot;Are Cosmological Theories Compatible with All
Possible Evidence: A Missing Methodological Link&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Bostrom">Nick
Bostrom</a> (Yale University)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/07/43/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>This paper argues that our current best cosmological theories, according to
which cosmos is very big are compatible with all possible evidence. The problem
is unrelated to the Quine-Duhem underdetermination thesis. The compatibility to
which this paper draws attention is much more radical: it appears as if all of
our best cosmological theories are perfectly probabilistically compatible with
all possible evidence and that no empirical discovery could give us any reason
whatever to favor one such theory over another. This consequence is absurd. In
order to create an evidential link between cosmological theory and observation,
a new methodological principle is needed. A candidate for such a principle is
proposed, using a Bayesian framework that takes account of observation selection
effects. Various applications in other scientific fields are considered.</p>

<p>I discuss the behavior of the Akaike Information Criterion in the limit when
the sample size grows. I show the falsity of the claim made recently by Stanley
Mulaik in Philosophy of Science that AIC would not distinguish between saturated
and other correct factor analytic models in this limit. I explain the meaning
and demonstrate the validity of the familiar, more moderate criticism that AIC
is not a consistent estimator of the number of parameters of the smallest
correct model. I also give a short explanation why this feature of AIC is
compatible with the motives of using it.</p>
