<h1 align="left"><a name="30W"></a><i>Causation &amp; Bayesian Networks</i>
(Workshop)</h1>
<p>Bayesian networks are the generalized nonlinear versions of Sewall Wright's
path models. Bayes nets have gained ground in the artificial intelligence and
business communities for their ability to represent and compute efficiently the
probabilistic dependencies necessary for reasoning under uncertainty. What makes
Bayes nets most compelling however is their close connection with causal
inference and causation.</p>
<p>Following Judea Pearl's advances in the graph-theoretic underpinnings of
probabilistic independence, researchers at CMU, UCLA, Monash, Microsoft, and a
few other centers have developed algorithms for reasoning about and representing
causality and causal manipulation using Bayes nets, and for automatically
inferring causal structure from statistical data using the constraints implied
by graph theory. The best known program for automated causal inference may be
CMU's TETRAD II.</p>
<p>More recently, Clark Glymour has teamed up with Patricia Cheng and Alison
Gopnik and by applying Bayes nets they have drastically improved psychological
theories of human causal inference and causal reasoning. Working in parallel,
researchers at Stanford have shown how human causal inference can be modeled as
Bayesian inference about Bayesian networks.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting for philosophers, Pearl's recent book Causality
builds on the insight from both his research team and that at CMU and engages
the philosophical literature on causation with surprising insights about not
only type causation but token causation and causal processes.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Bayes nets provide a much more powerful representation
for reasoning about causation than is commonly used in philosophy. While a few
philosophers from Herbert Simon to Nancy Cartwright, Clark Glymour, Paul
Humphries, and Gurol Irzik have been urging us to use path models all along, the
full theory of probabilistic independency was not worked out until the mid-80s,
and only more recently has the causal interpretation of Bayes nets been set out
reasonably clearly.</p>
<p>The purpose of this seminar is to bring together leading researchers in
Bayesian networks, drawn from philosophy, computer science, and artificial
intelligence and attempt to arrive at some consensual understanding of the
difficulties, insights and opportunities for Bayesian networks offer to
philosophers of causation.</p>

<p>Recent work by philosophers is helping to change the psychology of learning.
Examples include: the first full characterization of the equilibria of the
Rescola Wagner dynamical learning model, which has influened psychology for
almost three decades; the development of dynamical, minimal memory learning
models for alternative learning models; the design and conduct of crucial tests
to separate various causal learning algorithms; and the introduction of novel
experimental designs to investigate learning of (relatively) complex causal
structures from association and manipulation data.</p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">We outline a more precise cognitive and computational account of the
&quot;theory theory&quot; of cognitive development. Theories and
theory-formation processes are cognitive systems that allow us to recover an
accurate &quot;causal map&quot; of the world: an abstract, coherent
representation of the causal relations among events. This kind of knowledge can
be perspicuously represented by the formalism of directed graphical causal
models, or &quot;Bayes nets&quot;. Human theory formation may involve similar
computations. Preliminary experimental results suggest that 2- to 4-year-old
children spontaneously construct new causal maps and that they assume one of the
fundamental axioms of Bayes net systems.</span></p>

<p>Most computational work on causal discovery focuses on problems of data
mining -- inferring causal structure from very large samples and little prior
knowledge. However, people routinely make sophisticated causal inferences from
very little data -- often from just one or a few observations. We argue that
these inferences can be explained as Bayesian computations over a hypothesis
space of causal graphical models, shaped by strong top-down prior knowledge in
the form of intuitive theories. We present several case studies of our approach,
including quantitative models of people's causal judgments and brief comparisons
with traditional bottom-up models of causal inference.</p>
