<h1 align="left"><a name="19W"></a><i>Evidencing The Book of Evidence</i>
(Workshop)</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">This workshop focuses on
the latest book by Peter Achinstein (distinguished philosopher of science and
winner of the Lakatos Award): <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Book of Evidence</i> (Oxford Univeristy Press, 2001). This book is a
very substantial elaboration and modification of earlier work by Achinstein on
the concept of evidence. It provides a deeper philosophical foundation for the
theory and justifies and unifies his claims. One driving motivation for the work
is to develop a practical concept of evidence, meaning one that will be of use
to working scientists. To do so, he develops a robust concept of evidence that
is much more demanding than all of the standard accounts of evidence considered
in the philosophical literature. In developing it, he uses historical case
studies to substantiate the claim that his notion will be of use to working
scientists. He shows how it provides a better understanding of important
evidential claims made by key figures in the history of science. (In the
early chapters, Achinstein provides a fine historical
analysis of cathode ray experiments done by Hertz and later by Thompson in
developing his analysis of evidence. In later chapters, he addresses two
historical questions pertaining to Perrin's evidence for molecules and more
generally for scientific realism, and to Thomson's evidence for electrons, and
uses his concept of evidence to provide a better understanding of Perrin's and
Thomson's evidential claims.) Another driving force is his deep insight that a
practical concept of evidence will also be one that can to solve many of the
well-known philosophical puzzles and paradoxes of evidence. (Among those that he
addresses in the last third of the book are the grue, ravens, lottery, and
old-evidence paradoxes, the question of whether explanations or predictions
furnish more evidential weight, and the Duhem-Quine thesis of holism.) So, the
book and the symposium will be of special interest to philosophers of science.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The basic idea of
Achinstein’s book is that evidence for a hypothesis must provide a good reason
for believing the hypothesis. This idea makes his demands on a concept of
evidence go well beyond those of the standard ones including Bayesian,
boostrapping, likelihood, error-statistical, and hypothetico-deductive concepts.
To ensure that his concept meshes well with the practice of science, he also
insists that a reason for believing a hypothesis must be an objective rather
than a subjective matter, and that the goodness of a reason for believing must
be assessed on empirical rather than <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">a
priori</i> grounds. These constraints are also at variance with many of the
standard concepts.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The book attempts to
develop the ideas above in terms of a probability requirement that involves the
notion of an explanatory connection—it is shown in the book how
this notion may be understood in terms of Achinstein’s theory of explanation,
which he developed in previous writings. Let <span style="mso-text-raise:-3.0pt"><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype

 ; this was not done in his earlier writings. What is also new and likely to be
controversial is his theory of objective epistemic probability, which he
develops for the evidence condition. According to this theory, probability is a
measure of the degree of reasonableness of belief in a proposition. This is an
objective notion that is not relativized to what any actual or type of person
knows or believes. It can, however, be relativized to various assumptions and
special conditions, such as his “disregarding” condition (pp. 106-108). By
reference to evidence, defined in this sense, various other concepts of evidence
employed in the sciences are defined: ES (epistemic situation), subjective, and
veridical evidence. He demonstrates that none of the standard theories of
evidence is adequate to define any of these concepts, which he take to be the
ones actually used in the sciences.<o:p>

mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">The explication of “scientific evidence” in Peter
Achinstein’s The Book of Evidence builds upon the hybrid
probability/explanatory model he set out almost twenty-five years earlier in
“The Concept of Evidence” and The Nature of Explanation. Still in place are
the twin pillars of the view, a condition requiring a high posterior probability
for the truth of the hypothesis and a condition requiring high probability for
the existence of an explanatory connection between the hypothesis and the
evidence statement. What is radically different in the view is Achinstein’s
new objective epistemic interpretation of probability that separates degree of
belief from probability of truth. On this new view, reasonableness of belief is
what Achinstein terms a threshold concept that abandons the smoothness of
probability for a discontinuous structure. Reasonableness of belief proceeds
through discrete steps once a threshold value of probability has been exceeded.
In The Book of Evidence, Achinstein discusses how his probabilistic conditions
handle several of the classic problems of evidence, e.g., Hempel’s raven
paradox, Goodman’s grue paradox, and Glymour’s problem of old evidence, in
light of their recasting within the new interpretation of the probability
calculus. Each of these problems has received treatment by Achinstein in
previous publications. This presentation will consider how Achinstein’s new
objective epistemic view of probability affects his previous solutions to these
long-standing puzzles of scientific evidence.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Peter Achinstein’s new book aims to develop an
account of evidence that will explain how that notion figures in scientific
contexts. His treatment consists partly in critiques of rival views and partly
in an articulation of his own suggestion. I’ll be concerned with the latter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">At the heart of Achinstein’s proposal is a
notion of objective epistemic probability, understood as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">degree
of reasonableness of belief</i>. Although Achinstein says a lot of useful things
about the properties any such measure should have, I think he leaves crucial
lacunae that affect the ability of scientists (or reconstructing philosophers)
to pin down the degree to which it’s reasonable to believe something in a
particular context.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I see Achinstein as bravely defending the
possibility of a formal theory of evidence. But I claim that we’re unlikely to
obtain any such formal theory that will apply to the contexts in which
scientific work is done. Philosophers are good at explicating the tactics of
scientific argumentation. Philosophical advice about strategy is much more
vague, and understandably so. Assessing evidence in a scientific context
typically involves recognizing alternative possibilities, variously encumbered
with difficulties and unsolved puzzles. Attempting to pin a measure on the
degree of reasonableness of a belief would typically require some calculus for
weighing promise against difficulty. Scientific debates occur precisely because
no such calculus is available.</p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">But
scientists often can and do make qualitative estimates. The heart of a theory of
evidence should consist in understanding the heuristic strategies by which they
do so. In some parts of his book, Achinstein can be seen as providing useful
hints towards a theory of this kind. But he is, I believe, beguiled by the
philosopher’s dream of a formal theory.</p>
