<p>In this paper, I investigate the nature of a priori biological laws in
connection with the idea that laws must be empirical. I argue that the epistemic
functions of a priori biological laws in biology are the same as those of
empirical laws in physics. Thus, the requirement that laws be empirical is idle
in connection with how laws operate in science. This result presents a choice
between sticking with an unmotivated philosophical requirement and taking the
functional equivalence of laws seriously and modifying our philosophical
account. I favor the latter.</p>

<p>Ecologists typically invoke &quot;lawlike&quot; generalizations, ranging over
&quot;structural&quot; and/or &quot;functional&quot; kinds, in order to explain
generalizations about &quot;historical&quot; kinds (such as biological taxa) –
rather than vice versa. This practice is justified, since structural and
functional kinds tend to correlate better with important ecological phenomena
than do historical kinds. I support these contentions with three recent case
studies. In one sense, then, ecology is, and should be, more nomothetic, or
law-based, than ideographic, or historically-based. This conclusion challenges
several recent philosophical claims about the nature of ecological science.</p>

<p>In this paper I defend fundamental physical laws against the arguments
presented by Nancy Cartwright in <i>The Dappled World</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="108"></a><b>&quot;On The Metaphysics of Probabilistic Causation:
Lessons from Social Epidemiology&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Glymour">Bruce

<p>I argue that the orthodox account of probabilistic causation, on which
probabilistic causes determine the probability of their effects, is inconsistent
with certain ontological assumptions implicit in scientific practice. In
particular, scientists recognize the possibility that properties of populations
can cause the behavior of members of the populations. Such emergent population
level causation is metaphysically impossible on the orthodoxy.</p>
