<h1 align="left"><a name="23W"></a><i>Counterfactuals and Causality</i>
(Workshop)</h1>
<p>Until very recently, the best philosophical literature on causality assumed
without question that there is an intimate, if not essential, connection between
counterfactual conditionals and causal explanations. Covering law accounts
treated causal explanations as derivations of canonical descriptions of effects
from descriptions of initial conditions and lawlike generalizations whose
explanatory value was supposed to depend upon the ability of the lawlike
generalizations to support counterfactual conditionals. David Lewis and Jim
Woodward rejected this account, without questioning whether questioning the
importance of counterfactual conditionals. For Lewis, the adequacy of a causal
claim depends upon the truth of a counterfactual conditional whose truth value
is decided by what goes on in the most accessible possible world(s) which do not
include the putative cause. For Woodward the adequacy of a causal explanation
depends upon the upon the truth of counterfactual conditionals about what would
have resulted from ideal manipulations of putative cause. This illustrates how
accounts of causal explanation have come and gone while the importance of
counterfactual conditionals remained unquestioned. </p>
<p>Are counterfactual conditionals well enough behaved, and well enough
understood to help us understand causality and causal explanation? Lewis and
Stalnaker provided an elegant possible world semantics for counterfactuals. But
persisting difficulties with regard to these conditionals show that that
semantics alone isn't enough to relieve important doubts about them. It has
seemed to some that Lewis' counterfactual account of causality cannot be applied
to particular cases without arbitrary assumptions about the structures of the
closest possible worlds. The epistemology of counterfactual claims remains
clouded. And Nuel Belnap's and his associates' theory of branching space times (BST)
provides reason to doubt whether even probabilistic counterfactual conditional
claims about indeterministic systems have truth values where the received
accounts of causal explanation need them. </p>
<p>In view of such difficulties, would be nice if causal explanation could be
accounted for without appeal to counterfactual conditionals. One of the
attractions of the Mechanistic theory of explanation of Machamer, Darden, and
Craver ['Thinking About Mechanisms', Philosophy of Science, March, 2000] is that
it attempts to do just that. Machamer, Darden, and Craver understand causally
productive relations in terms of the contributions made by the activities of the
parts of a system which produces an effect to that effect's production. But
Woodward [PSA Symposia, 2000 forthcoming] argues that the difference between
causally productive and causally irrelevant activities cannot be understood
without appeal to counterfactual conditionals. </p>
<p>This background gives rise to the issues to be taken up in this proposed
symposium. They center around the questions of whether counterfactual
conditionals can be dispensed with in accounts of causality, and whether there
is good reason to think they should be. And because BST gives rise to serious
obstacles to counterfactual based accounts of causal explanations of
non-deterministically produced effects, the proposed symposium includes a
preliminary discussion of the place of causality in branching space-time.</p>

<p>Branching space-times (BST) theory, as developed elsewhere, permits a sound
and rigorously definable notion of ``originating cause'' or causa causans---a
type of transition event---of an outcome event. Mackie has famously suggested
that causes form a family of ``inus'' conditions, where an inus condition is
``an insufficient but non-redundant part of an unnecessary sufficient
condition.'' In this essay the needed concepts of BST theory are developed in
detail, and it is then proved that the causae causantes a given outcome event
have exactly the structure of a set of Mackie inus conditions. The proof
requires the assumption that there is no EPR-like ``funny business.'' This seems
enough to constitute a theory of ``causation'' in at least one of its many
senses.</p>

indeterminate systems (e.g., ‘if Jones decides to go to the market, then he
will meet someone who owes him money’) are neither true nor false at the time
they are made. Related
considerations argue for the same conclusion with regard to the kinds of
counterfactual conditionals Woodward thinks we need to distinguish causally
productive from causally irrelevant relations, as well as the kinds of
counterfactuals David Lewis relies on in his account of causality. After setting out the arguments for this, I will make a few suggestions
about the kinds of conditionals which I think are involved in causal
explanation.</span></p>

<p>Activities are what relate entities within a mechanism. Activities refer to
what entities do, and how, in so doing, they affect other entities and
activities. It is often unwarrantedly assumed that the kinds of entities are
ontologically or epistemically prior to activities. Mechanisms are the way to
spell out causal relations. What activities are working determines if they are
actually causally relevant. Establishing mechanisms characterizes Leibnizian
necessity, the closing off of possibilities. This is the only necessity.</p>
