<p>This paper aims: (1) to show that Lawrence Sklar`s recent attempt to reduce
thermodynamics(TD) to statistical mechanics(SM) is fallacious in several
respects; and (2) to suggest a broader conclusion that a more useful way of
understanding the relationship between TD and SM is as collaboration and
competition among alternative methodologies rather than reduction of one theory
to another. To argue for (1), I discuss two cases (the distinction of
intensive/extensive variables in TD and the existence of phase transitions)
where TD is more accurate than statistical mechnaics and thus corrects SM. I
also discuss the case of temperature in order to argue for both (1) and (2).</p>

<p>Textbooks in quantum mechanics frequently claim that quantum mechanics
explains the success of classical mechanics because “the mean values [of
quantum mechanical observables] follow the classical equations of motion to a
good approximation,” while “the dimensions of the wave packet be small with
respect to the characteristic dimensions of the problem.” The equations in
question are Ehrenfest’s famous equations. We examine this case for the
one-dimensional motion of a particle in a box, and extend the idea deriving a
special case of the ideal gas law in terms of the mean value of a generalized
force, which has been used in statistical mechanics to define ‘pressure’.
The example may be an important test case for recent philosophical theories
about the relationship between micro-theories and macro-theories in science.</p>

<h2><a name="103"></a><b>&quot;Reduction, Autonomy and Causal Exclusion Among
Physical Properties&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Rueger">Alexander

<p>Is there a problem of causal exclusion between micro- and macro-level
physical properties? I argue that the properties that in fact are in competition
are both macro, viz., the property of a (macro-) system of ‘having
such-and-such macro properties` (call this a ‘macro property`) and the
property of the same system of ‘being constituted by such-and-such a
micro-structure` (call this a ‘micro-structural property`). I show that there
are cases where, for lack of reducibility, there is a prima facie intra-level
causal competition between the two kinds of properties. The problem can be
resolved without giving up on the causal efficacy of the macro properties if we
understand instances of macro properties to be parts of micro-structural
property instances. The parthood relation of between both kinds of property
instances can be mapped onto the way physical theory deals with the relation of
their descriptions in the framework of perturbation theory.</p>

Realism and the Autonomy of Chemistry&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Jenkins">Zack

<p>Eric Scerri and other authors have acknowledged that the reality of chemical
orbitals is not compatible with quantum mechanics. Recently, however, Scerri and
Sharon Crasnow have argued that if chemists cannot consider orbitals as real
entities, then chemistry is in danger of being reduced to physics. I argue that
the question of the existence of orbitals is best viewed as an issue of
approximation, not metaphysics: in many chemically important cases orbitals do
not make sufficiently accurate predictions, and must be replaced. Chemists and
physicists can acknowledge this fact while maintaining the utility of orbitals
and the autonomy of chemistry.</p>
