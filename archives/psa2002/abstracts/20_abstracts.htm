<h1 align="left"><a name="20"></a><i>Bohr`s Philosophy of Quantum Theory: A New
Look</i> (Symposium)</h1>
<p>Although there have been a few philosophers who have worked seriously on Bohr’s
approach to quantum theory, it has for the most part been dismissed as
incoherent, or as irrelevant to the concerns of contemporary philosophy of
physics. Proponents of Bohm’s theory, for example, often contrast the ‘clarity’
of Bohm’s view with the ‘incoherence’ of Bohr’s. This attitude was more
recently expressed at some length by Beller (1999), who claims that Bohr’s
statements about quantum theory can be understood only if we presume him to have
been a radical operationalist or simple-minded positivist. (Neither view would
get him very far in today’s climate in philosophy of physics.) However, recent
work by a few philosophers of physics has revealed that Bohr’s approach to
quantum theory can be understood in reasonable terms, and that much of what he
says about quantum theory is relevant to contemporary work in the field. </p>
<p>For example, one complaint often lodged against Bohr is that he made use of
an unanalyzed notion of ‘measurement’, in precisely the way that
contemporary philosophers of physics find unaccepable in an approach to the
measurement problem. In particular, Bohr is supposed to have said that ‘the
measurement’ determines what properties a system can and cannot have, thus
giving rise to the doctrine of complementarity. It is further supposed that Bohr
had nothing useful to say about how or why ‘the measurement’ determines
which properties a system can and cannot have, so that his doctrine of
complementarity is supposed to have been a rather unconvincing dogma. </p>
<p>However, a closer look at Bohr’s work shows that he spent a great deal of
effort trying to understand how the conditions required for the empirical well-definedness
of a given physical concept (such as position) rule out the empirical well-definedness
of other physical concepts (such as momentum). He did not rely on an unanalyzed
notion of ‘measurement’. In other words, Bohr did argue for his view, and
the arguments are in some cases very convincing. </p>
<p>What is more, those arguments resonate with issues that are at the very
center of contemporary philosophy of physics. For example, work on the so-called
‘modal’ interpretations of quantum theory has led to a deep mathematical
understanding of ‘incompatibility’. In particular, due to a number of
theorems from lattice theory and abstract algebra, we can say with a great deal
of mathematical precision just why the well-definedness of a given physical
property rules out the well-definedness of some other physical properties. In
other words, we have a very rich mathematical account of incompatibility. </p>
<p>Bohr can illuminate the situation because he was concerned with the ‘physical’
account of incompatibility. As described above, he was concerned with how the
conditions required for the empirical well-definedness of one of a pair of
complementary physical properties are incompatible with the conditions required
for the empirical well-definedness of the other. In other words, Bohr’s
arguments can help us to understand how—or why—these recent mathematical
results apply to the physical world. </p>
<p>Along similar lines, Bohr offers us a fresh view of an issue that arose at
the PSA in 1996, ‘na¨ýve realism about operators’. The issue is this: why
should we take the Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory seriously? That is,
why should we presume that there is a simple connection between the operators on
Hilbert space (and the relations between them) and the physical properties of
physical systems (and the relations between them)? Again, Bohr provides
arguments that take us from considerations of the empirical meaning of physical
notions (such as ‘position’, ‘momentum’, ‘energy’, and so on) to the
proper mathematical formalism to describe those physical notions. And he did so
self-consciously. His claim, then, that the formalism of quantum theory was ‘inevitable’,
and that the lessons that formalism teaches us are ‘necessary’, are not
based on a ‘na¨ýve’ view about the formalism, but on careful physical
considerations. </p>
<p>So in these cases and in others, contemporary philosophy of physics has
something to learn from Bohr. At the same time, Bohr’s philosophy of quantum
theory has something to gain from the conceptual resources and mathematical
tools of contemporary philosophy of physics: we can use those resources and
tools to re-express in perhaps more compelling terms the views that Bohr put
forward. And we can do so while remaining sensitive to the historical Bohr, that
is, without distorting his basic message. </p>
<p>This symposium is intended to illustrate in detail the sorts of consideration
that are rehearsed briefly above. All of the participants have been closely
involved in the ‘rennaisance’ of Bohr’s philosophy that has been occurring
over the past year or so. Don Howard has been arguing for many years that Bohr’s
message is not entirely incoherent and inscrutable. Scott Tanona is writing a
dissertation explicating Bohr’s account of the correspondence principle and
its role in the development of the notion of complementarity, and relating those
issues to issues from contemporary philosophy of physics. (Tanona is presently
at Indiana University—a student of Michael Friedman and Michael Dickson—but
he will be finished by the end of this year and should be located somewhere else
next year when the PSA occurs.) Michael Dickson has recently been writing and
delivering talks about Bohr’s reply to EPR. Rob Clifton and Hans Halvorson
have recently shown how to express Bohr’s reply to EPR in algebraic terms
(allowing one to speak legitimately of precise positions and precise momenta,
though—as they show in detail—not both simultaneously), and are now working
on expressing other aspects of Bohr’s view in these terms. </p>
<p>The symposium should prove to be of wide interest and quite provocative. The
idea that Bohr might have something useful to say to contemporary philosophy of
physics is still very much a minority view. (One of us was recently told that
only crazy people would work on this topic—and this comment came from somebody
who himself works on the theory of ‘branching space-times’ !) Nonetheless,
there has been enough work in this area over the past year or so (see, for
example, the references in some of the abstracts) to show that it is in fact not
crazy to suppose that Bohr had something useful to say.</p>

<p>We provide the common framework needed to assess the relative merits of Bohr
and Bohm's interpretations of quantum mechanics. More precisely, we show that
Bohr's complementarity interpretation can be explicated by means of the notion
of inequivalent representations in algebraic quantum mechanics, and we then show
that Bohm's interpretation results if we assume that the position representation
is the unique physically preferred representation. Thus, there is a
mathematically rigorous sense in which Bohm's intepretation is the
&quot;position half&quot; of Bohr's dualistic &quot;postion-momentum&quot;
interpretation. We then discuss Bohr's claim that ignoring the &quot;momentum
half&quot; of quantum theory will result in loss of essential theoretical
content.</p>

<a href="../program_authors.htm#Dickson">Michael Dickson</a> (Indiana

<p>Taking a cue from Bohr's use of the notion of a reference frame in his reply
to EPR's argument against the completeness (and consistency) of standard quantum
theory, this paper presents an analysis of EPR's argument using a
quantum-theoretical account of reference frames based on the work of Mackey, and
Aharonov and Kaufherr. That analysis appears to justify at least some crucial
aspects of a Bohrian reply to EPR.</p>

<p>The doctrines about the interpretation of quantum mechanics normally
clustered together under the heading of the “Copenhagen interpretation” are
interesting in part because many, if not most of them, such as wavepacket
collapse, were never asserted by the individual normally regarded as the founder
of the Copenhagen view, Niels Bohr. In other papers (e.g., “What Makes a
Classical Concept Classical?” and “A Brief on Behalf of Bohr”) I have
attempted to disentangle Bohr’s own views from the views wrongly attributed to
him as part of a Copenhagen interpretation. In this paper, I will start by
reviewing arguments that I have earlier made placing the physical fact of non-separability
or entanglement at the heart of a proper understanding of Bohr’s position, and
then sketching the implications of this reading of Bohr for other famous Bohrian
doctrines, such as his views on classical concepts. But the main focus of the
paper will be an exploration of the way in which the myth of the Copenhagen
interpretation first emerged. There certainly was a professional and social
community centered around Bohr and his institute, and there was what one might
term a Copenhagen ‘Geist’. But it will be suggested that it was Heisenberg,
rather than Bohr, who was primarily responsible for promoting in the early 1950s
the idea of a unitary Copenhagen perspective on the interpretation question,
that Heisenberg’s status then as an exile from the Copenhagen community,
thanks to his work on the German bomb, was an important factor in inclining him
to this fabrication, and that the philosophical reception of Heisenberg’s
writings from this period on the part of, especially, Popper and Feyerabend, was
crucial for legitimating the myth.</p>

<h2><a name="20D"></a><b>&quot;Idealization and Formalism in Bohr's Approach to
Quantum Theory&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Tanona">Scott

<p>Bohr held that quantum mechanical symbols find meaning only in the context of
an experimental setting. Making a measurement requires establishing a
correspondence between a property of the quantum object and a property of the
measuring system via the introduction of a classical quantity with which the
measuring instrument, classically understood, interacts. However, this
correspondence is only approximate and involves the use of certain
idealizations, and it is the commutation rules that tell us the limitations to
this process. In this context I will examine the caution by Daumer, et. al.
(1996) against taking too seriously the idea of operators as observables. I
conclude that Bohr would neither ascribe to such 'naive realism' about operators
nor dismiss the formalism as unimportant to the understanding of quantum
phenomena. Rather, Bohr's approach to quantum theory suggests a middle ground.</p>
