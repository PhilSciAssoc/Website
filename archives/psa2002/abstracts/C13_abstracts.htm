Mechanics?&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Bueno">Otávio

<p>Hartry Field [1980] has developed an interesting nominalization strategy for
Newtonian gravitation theory -- a strategy that reformulates the theory without
quantification over abstract entities. According to David Malament [1982], Field’s
strategy cannot be extended to quantum mechanics (QM), and so it only has a
limited scope. In a recent work, Mark Balaguer has responded to Malament’s
challenge, by indicating how QM can be nominalized, and by “doing much of the
work needed to provide the nominalization” (Balaguer [1998], 114). In this
paper, I critically assess Balaguer’s proposal, and argue that it ultimately
fails. Balaguer’s strategy is incompatible with a number of interpretations of
QM, in particular with Bas van Fraassen’s version of the modal interpretation.
And given that Balaguer’s strategy invokes physically real propensities, it is
unclear whether it is even compatible with nominalism. I conclude that the
nominalization of QM still remains a major problem for the nominalist.</p>

Fuzzy Link&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Lewis">Peter

<p>It is widely acknowledged that the link between quantum language and ordinary
language must be “fuzzier” than the traditional eigenstate-eigenvalue link.
In the context of spontaneous collapse theories, Albert and Loewer (1996) argue
that the form of this fuzzy link is a matter of convention, and can be freely
chosen to minimize anomalies for those theories. I defend the position that the
form of the link is empirical, and could be such as to render collapse theories
idle. This means that defenders of spontaneous collapse theories must gamble
that the actual form of the link renders such theories tenable.</p>

<p>There exist well-known conundrums, such as measure theoretic paradoxes and
problems of contact, which, within the context of classical physics, can be used
to argue against the existence of points in space and space-time. I examine
whether quantum mechanics provides additional reasons for supposing that there
are no points in space and space-time.</p>

<h2><a name="73"></a><b>&quot;Remarks on the Direction of Time in Quantum
Mechanics&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Hemmo">Meir

<p>I consider the question of the direction of time in the context of the many
worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics. I focus on the special role of
decoherence in the recovery of time asymmetric behaviour, such as the collapse
of the quantum state and the thermodynamic regularities. The discussion is based
on results in the consistent histories approach (Gell-Mann and Hartle 1993) and
decoherence theory (Zurek and Paz 1994). Finally, I compare the explanation of
the direction of time in the MWI and in a recent proposal by Albert (2001) based
on the GRW collapse theory.</p>
