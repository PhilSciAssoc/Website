<h2><a name="83"></a><b>&quot;A Matter of Degree: Putting Unitary Equivalence to
Work&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Ruetsche">Laura
Ruetsche</a> (University of Pittsburgh)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/10/95/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>A characteristic feature of quantum field theory is the availability of
unitarily inequivalent representations of its canonical commutation relations.
Under the prima facie reasonable assumption that unitary equivalence is a
necessary condition for physical equivalence, this availability implies that
there are many physically inequivalent quantizations of any classical field
theory. To explore this dramatic non-uniqueness, and its implications for our
understanding of how physical theories delimit physical possibility, I examine
some of the uses to which unitarily inequivalent representations are put in
another setting in which they arise: the thermodynamic limit of quantum
statistical mechanics.</p>

<h2><a name="93"></a><b>&quot;Ontology Schmontology? Identity, Individuation and
Fock Space&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Gordon">Bruce
L. Gordon</a> (Baylor University)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/10/72/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>It is argued that if the nature of the &quot;equivalence&quot; between first-quantized
particle theories and second- quantized (Fock Space) theories is examined
closely, if the inadequacies of de Muynck`s &quot;indexed particle&quot; version
of Fock Space are recognized, and if the question is not begged against modal
metaphysics, then van Fraassen`s attempted deflation of ontological issues in
quantum theory can be seen to fail.</p>

<h2><a name="181"></a><b>&quot;A Loophole in Bell`s Theorem? Parameter
Dependence in the Hess-Philipp Model&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Myrvold">Wayne
C. Myrvold</a> (University of Western Ontario)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/10/90/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>The hidden-variables model constructed by Karl Hess and Walter Philipp is
claimed by its authors to exploit a &quot;loophole&quot; in Bell`s theorem; the
claim is made by Hess and Philipp that the parameters employed in their model
extend beyond those considered by Bell. Furthermore, they claim that their model
satisfies Einstein locality and is free of any &quot;suspicion of spooky action
at a distance.&quot; Both of these claims are false; the Hess-Philipp model
achieves agreement with the quantum-mechanical predictions, not by circumventing
Bell`s theorem, but via Parameter Dependence.</p>

<h2><a name="63"></a><b>&quot;Another No-Go Theorem for Hidden Variable Models
of Inaccurate Spin 1 Measurements&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Breuer">Thomas

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="mso-fareast-language: DE" lang="EN-GB">Uncertainty
about the actual orientation of the measurement device has been claimed to open
a loophole for hidden variable models of quantum mechanics. In this paper I
describe <span style="mso-fareast-language: DE">the statistics of inaccurate
spin measurements by unsharp spin observables. A no-go theorem for hidden
variable models of the inaccurate measurement statistics follows: There is a
finite set of directions for which not all results of inaccurate spin
measurements can be predetermined in a non-contextual way. In contrast to an
earlier theorem [Breuer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88(2002), 240402] this result does not
rely on the assigment of approximate truth values, and it holds under weaker
assumptions on the measurement inaccuracy.</span></span></p>
