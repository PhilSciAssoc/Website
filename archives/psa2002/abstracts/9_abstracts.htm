<h1 align="left"><a name="9"></a><i>Laws, Possibility, and the New
Instrumentalism</i> (Symposium)</h1>
<p>Laws would appear to provide the cornerstone to many scientific theories. Thus understanding what is involved in a
generalization constituting a law and understanding the role of laws in theories provide centrally important issues in the interpretation of science.
There is a
 wide range of strikingly different
approaches to these questions, all of which have serious drawbacks and none of which command
general acceptance.</p>
<p>The symposium will address
this subject by exploring some fresh ways of
 thinking about the relation between
laws and possibility. Many current approaches to laws start 
 from the presumption that a law can be
thought of as a generalization which holds exactly in all 
 of a range of possible worlds, the
worlds corresponding to the modality appropriate to the 
 subject. So, to be a physical law is
to be a generalization that holds exactly in all physically 
 possible worlds. The three papers to
be presented in this symposium criticize various aspects of 
 this conception and explore
alternative ways of characterizing the connection between laws and 
 possibility, as explained in the
attached abstracts. Mathias Frisch and Eric Winsberg argue that 
 the conception of laws as delineating
possible worlds is flawed and should be replaced by an 
 instrumentalist construal of laws.
Arnold Koslow shares the view that a possible worlds 
 semantics for laws is problematic but
argues that laws can nevertheless be construed as 
 narrowing down possibilities.</p>
<p>An attractive aspect of the symposium
will be the opportunity to explore possible 
 common grounds in such new approaches
arising from the work of philosophers with strikingly 
 different starting points and general
attitudes towards the analysis of science. Two of the 
 contributors, Mathias Frisch and Eric
Winsberg, are younger scholars who have been working 
 within the modeling tradition of Nancy
Cartwright and Ron Giere. On the other hand, Arnie 
 Koslow is a very well established
philosopher whose work on science and logic has followed 
 more traditional lines. It is
particularly interesting to see some points of possible (if I may so <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">speak!)
convergence of ideas among scholars coming from such different traditions: I
will look</font> <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">at similarities and differences
between the instrumentalist, or model building, conclusions of</font> <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">Frisch
and Winsberg, on the one hand, and the characterization in terms of narrowing
down of</font> <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">possibilities of Koslow on the
other. I particularly look forward, in my role as commentator for</font> <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">the
symposium, to the opportunity to examine the points of agreement and difference
in the ways</font> <font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">that all three of the
symposiasts explore alternative ways of thinking about the interplay between</font>
<font FACE="TimesNewRomanPSMT">laws and possibility.</font></p>

<h2><a name="9A"></a><b>&quot;Laws and Initial Conditions&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="../program_authors.htm#Frisch">Mathias
Frisch</a> (Northwestern University)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In this paper I challenge the traditional distinction between laws that
delineate physically possible words and initial conditions. I discuss two
examples from classical electrodynamics that challenge different aspects of this
distinction. The first example concerns a case of &quot;shell-crossing&quot; in
the electrodynamics of continuous charge distributions, which prohibits global
solutions to the Maxwell-Lorentz equations for many reasonable initial
conditions. The second example concerns the use of an asymptotic condition in
deriving an equation of motion for a charged particle that seems to express a
physically contingent fact even though it is mathematically necessary for
deriving the equation of motion.</p>

Mechanics&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Winsberg">Eric
Winsberg</a> (University of South Florida)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This paper explores some connections between competing conceptions of
scientific laws on the one hand, and a problem in the foundations of statistical
mechanics on the other. In the paper, I examine two proposals for understanding
the time asymmetry of thermodynamic phenomena. One is David Albert's recent
proposal and the other is a proposal that I outline based on Hans Reichenbach's
&quot;branch systems&quot;. I sketch an argument against the former, and mount a
defense of the latter by showing how to accommodate statistical mechanics to
recent developments in the philosophy of scientific laws.</p>

<h2><a name="9B"></a><b>&quot;Laws and the Reduction of Possibilities&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="../program_authors.htm#Koslow">Arnold
Koslow</a> (City University of New York)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The first part of this paper briefly explores and rejects three standard
views of how scientific laws might be systematically connected with physical
necessity or possibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first
concerns laws and their consequences, the second concerns the so-called
counterfactual connection, and the third concerns a possible worlds construction
of physical necessity as a relativized necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the second part we develop an account of an overlooked but ubiquitous
notion of possibility, and, with the aid of some examples, illustrate the
special way in which laws do reduce possibilities.</p>
