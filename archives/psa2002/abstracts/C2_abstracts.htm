<p>Recent discussions of the nature of representation in science have tended to
import pre-established decompositions from analyses of representation in the
arts, language, cognition and so forth. Which of these analyses one favours will
depend on how one conceives of theories in the first place. If one thinks of
them in terms of an axiomatised set of logico-linguistic statements, then one
might be naturally drawn to accounts of linguistic representation in which
notions of denotation, for example, feature prominently. If, on the other hand,
one conceives of theories in non-linguistic terms, as in the model-theoretic
approach, then one might look to analyses of representation in the arts where
notions of resemblance tend to be brought to the fore. Thus van Fraassen, for
example, has imported such an analysis into his discussion of representation in
science and argued that an appropriate account of resemblance can be given in
terms of the set-theoretic relation of isomorphism. This has been strongly
criticised by Suarez, who argues that just as isomorphism cannot capture
representation in art, so it is inappropriate in the scientific context as well.
Similarly Hughes draws on Goodman`s rejection of resemblance in art in favour of
denotation and, rather confusingly perhaps, favours the latter whilst also
maintaining the model-theoretic view of theories. In this paper, I shall examine
the debate in terms of four claims: 1. Isomorphism is not sufficient for
representation; 2. Isomorphism is not necessary for representation; 3. Models
represent but theories do not; 4. Models denote and do not resemble. Each of
these claims will be questioned and I will conclude by suggesting that, through
appropriate modifications, a form of isomorphism can serve to underpin
representation in both the arts and science.</p>

<h2><a name="162-1"></a><b>&quot;A Parser as an Epistemic Artefact: A Material
View on Models&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Knuuttila">Tarja

<p>The purpose of this paper is to suggest that models in scientific practice
can be conceived of as epistemic artefacts. Approaching models this way
accommodates many such things that working scientists themselves call models but
which the semantic conception of models does not duly recognize as such. That
models are epistemic artefacts implies, firstly, that they cannot be understood
apart from purposeful human activity. Secondly, it implies that they are somehow
materialized inhabitants of the intersubjective field of human activity.
Thirdly, it implies that models can function also as knowledge objects. We argue
that models as epistemic artefacts give knowledge in many other ways than just
via direct representative links. To substantiate our view we use an example of a
language-technological artefact, a parser.</p>

<h2><a name="124"></a><b>&quot;Complex Systems, Trade-Offs and Theoretical
Population Biology: Richard Levin`s 'Strategy of Model Building in Population
Biology' Revisited&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Odenbaugh">Jay
Odenbaugh</a> (University of California, San Diego)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/10/92/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>Ecologist Richard Levins (1966, 1968) argues population biologists must
trade-off the generality, realism and precision of their models since biological
systems are complex and our limitations are severe. Elliott Sober and Steven
Orzack (1993) argue that there are cases where these model properties cannot be
varied independently of one another. If this is correct, then Levins` thesis
that there is a necessary trade-off between generality, precision, and realism
in mathematical models in biology is false. I argue that Sober and Orzack`s
arguments fail since Levins` thesis concerns the pragmatic features of model
building not just the formal properties of models.</p>

<h2><a name="57"></a><b>&quot;Data Models and the Acquisition and Manipulation
of Data&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Harris">Todd

<p>This paper offers an account of data manipulation in scientific experiments.
It will be shown that in many cases raw, unprocessed data is not produced, but
rather a form of processed data that will be referred to as a data model. The
language of data models will be used to provide a framework within which to
understand a current debate about the status of data and data manipulation. It
will be seen that a description in terms of data models allows one to understand
cases in which data acquisition and data manipulation cannot be separated into
two independent activities.</p>
