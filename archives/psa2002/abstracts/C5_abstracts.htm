<p>The first use of the term &quot;information&quot; to describe the content of
nervous impulse occurs in Edgar Adrian`s The Basis of Sensation (1928). What
concept of information does Adrian appeal to, and how can it be situated in
relation to contemporary philosophical accounts of the notion of information in
biology? The answer requires an explication Adrian’s use and an evaluation of
its situation in relation to more contemporary philosophical accounts of
semantic information. I suggest that Adrian`s concept of information places
limitations on the causal and functional accounts of information by
incorporating a naturalized concept of arbitrariness or semioticity.</p>

<p>This paper examines the notion that psychology is autonomous. It is argued
that we need to distinguish between (a) the question of whether psychological
explanations are autonomous, and (b) the question of whether the process of
psychological discovery is autonomous. The issue is approached by providing a
re-interpretation of Robert Cummins’ notion of functional analysis (FA). A
distinction is drawn between FA as an explanatory strategy and FA as an
investigative strategy. It is argued that the identification of functional
components of the cognitive system may draw on knowledge about brain structure,
without thereby jeopardizing the explanatory autonomy of psychology.</p>

examine the central theoretical construct of ecological psychology, the concept
of an <i><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">affordance</span></i>. In the first
part of the paper, I illustrate the role affordances play in Gibson’s theory
of perception. In the second part, I argue that affordances are to be understood
as dispositional properties, and </span>explain what I take to be their
characteristic background circumstances, triggering circumstances and
manifestations. The main purpose of my analysis is to give affordances a
theoretical identity enriched by Gibson’s visionary insight, but independent
of the most controversial claims of the Gibsonian movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<h2><a name="58"></a><b>&quot;Object and Event Concepts: A Cognitive Mechanism
of Incommensurability&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Chen">Xiang

<p>In this paper I examine a cognitive mechanism of incommensurability. Using
the frame model of concept representation to capture structural relations within
concepts, I reveal an ontological difference between object and event concepts:
the former are spatial but the latter temporal. Experiments from cognitive
sciences further demonstrate that the mind treats object and event concepts
differently. Thus, incommensurability can occur in conceptual change across
different ontological categories. I use a historical case to illustrate how the
ontological difference between an object and an event concept actually caused
incommensurability in the context of 19th-century optics. The cognitive and
historical analyses indicate that incommensurability can be a local phenomenon
and does not necessarily imply incomparability.</p>
