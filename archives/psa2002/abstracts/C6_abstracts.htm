<p>How does a complex organism develop from a relatively simple, homogeneous
mass? The usual answer is: through the execution of species-specific genetic
instructions specifying the development of that organism. Commentators are
sometimes sceptical of this usual answer, but of course not all commentators.
Some biologists refer to master control genes responsible for the activation of
all the genes responsible for every aspect of organismal development; and some
philosophers, most notoriously Rosenberg, buy this claim hook, line, and sinker.
Here I explore both the seeming plausibility of the usual position, and also its
ultimate inadequacy.</p>

<h2><a name="180"></a><b>&quot;Making Populations: Bounding Genes in Space and
in Time&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Gannett">Lisa

<p>The paper argues that, at least below the species level, biological
populations are not mind-independent objects that are discovered by scientists.
Rather, biological populations are pragmatically constituted as objects of
investigation according to the aims, interests, and values that inform specific
research contexts. Biological populations are defined on the basis of relations
among organisms such as breeding, genealogy, and competition. Although these
relations are objective, the kind and the degree of relations that are
privileged depend on the context of investigation. Although the groups
delineated are statistically defined open-ended biological systems, they are
rendered as discrete units in order to fulfil various theoretical and practical
aims.</p>

<h2><a name="86"></a><b>&quot;Heritability and Indirect Causation&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="../program_authors.htm#Sesardic">Neven

<p>Genetic differences can lead to phenotypic differences either directly or
indirectly (via causing differences in external environments, which then affect
phenotype). This possibility of genetic effects being mediated by environmental
influences is often used by scientists and philosophers to argue that
heritability is not a very helpful causal or explanatory notion. In this paper
it is shown that these criticisms are based on serious misconceptions about
methods of behavior genetics.</p>

<h2><a name="107"></a><b>&quot;Evolvability, Dispositions, and Intrinsicality&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="../program_authors.htm#Love">Alan
C. Love</a> (University of Pittsburgh)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/10/84/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>In this paper I examine a dispositional property that has been receiving
increased attention in biology, evolvability. First, I identify three compatible
but distinct investigative approaches, distinguish two interpretations of
evolvability, and treat the difference between dispositions of individuals
versus populations. Second, I explore the relevance of philosophical
distinctions about dispositions for evolvability, isolating the assumption that
dispositions are intrinsically located. In conclusion, I argue that some
instances of evolvability cannot be understood as purely intrinsic to
populations and suggest alternative strategies for resolving this difficulty.</p>
