<h1 align="left"><a name="G"></a><i>Is Methodology Gendered - and Should It Be?</i>
(Symposium)</h1>
<p>There has been a lively, on-going discussion of feminist philosophy of
science and feminist epistemology amongst philosophers of science. An early
influential work is the 1983 anthology edited by Sandra Harding and Merrill
Hintikka, Discovering Reality : Feminist Perspectives on Epistemology,
Metaphysics, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science. The most recent book to
arrive on my desk is Janet Kourany’s The Gender of Science, with a 2002
copyright date. When the editors of the British Journal of Philosophy of Science
commissioned survey articles for their special Millennium-2000 issue, one of the
themes they wanted covered was Feminist Philosophy of Science. (See Brit. J.
Phil. Sci. 51 (2000).) </p>
<p>The discussion so far has centered on feminist challenges to traditional
philosophical discussions of objectivity, theory-ladenness, underdermination,
realism, and the classic distinction between facts and values. Philosophers of
science have, by and large, paid much less attention to the detailed case
studies purporting to show that gender plays a major role in all facets of
scientific inquiry. However, it has now become standard practice in many areas
of the philosophy of scientific methodology to use case studies not only to
illustrate philosophical theses but also to provide naturalistic support for
them. Feminists have relied heavily on such examples, not only to argue for the
possibility that gender plays a role but also to intimate that the influence of
gender is ubiquitous. </p>
<p>In this symposium we will look in detail at some of the most interesting
recent case studies and evaluate what they suggest about the role of gender in
science.</p>

of Science&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Sargent">Rose-Mary

<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">In her recent case
study, Elizabeth Potter attempts to show how Boyle’s experimental method was
gender biased. Part of her argument focuses on the combination of the
“invisibility” of women in Boyle’s published work together with his
unpublished comments on female chastity, and part concerns Boyle’s rejection
of the animistic explanation of his air pump experiments by Francis Line. I
argue that the historical and biographical elements of the case make at least
part of Potter’s argument questionable. In addition, I address directly
whether and how such historical cases can shed light on current debates about
gender issues and methodology in the philosophy of science.<o:p>

<p>Feminist analyses of science have argued that the methodology of science does
not succeed in filtering out the effects of gender stereotypes and that the
result is often knowledge claims that contribute to the oppression of women.
However, there have been quite divergent feminist reactions to such a
conclusion. One response is to propose ways of strengthening the methods of
science in the hopes of removing gender bias. Another strategy is to try to
prevent harmful scientific results by making the role of social values in
science more positive and more salient. This paper looks at various
articulations of the second response, including Fausto-Sterling’s argument
that revising our binary concepts of sex and gender would not not only improve
the lot of intersexed and transgendered people in our society but would also
improve science. I use this example as an interesting challenge to the accounts
of the proper role of social values in science offered by Giere, Longino and
Kitcher.</p>

<p>The best feminist critique, by which I mean those critical discussions based
on arguments that are well-formulated and at least on their face appear to
present a serious challenge to the accepted foundations of scientific knowledge,
claims not to question either the possibility of, or desirability of, scientific
rationality. Yet in the end the best of the feminist critique relies on
decidedly a-rational means in its arguments for preferring a new approach to
science. And despite claims to be an epistemology of science, the best feminist
critique manages to be no more than a description of what is believed, rather
than a normative account of what should be believed or why some belief is
justified.</p>
