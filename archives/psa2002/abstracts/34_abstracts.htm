<h1 align="left"><a name="34"></a><i>The Making of the Genetical Theory of
Evolution</i> (Symposium)</h1>
<p>Recently, a number of philosophers have done important philosophical work on
the conceptual foundations of evolutionary theory and the role of its principal
architects in the early twentieth century. They have drawn upon this period in
addressing a number of issues of relevance to philosophy of science and
philosophy of biology more generally, such as, the nature of scientific
controversy, the role of mathematics in biological thought, the nature of
biological explanations, and whether or how biology is a unified or
&quot;pluralistic&quot; science. This symposium brings together a group of
philosophers of biology who have staked out novel positions on these issues. </p>
<p>When R. A. Fisher, Sewall Wright, and J.B.S. Haldane - three major
contributors to the development of the mathematical theory of evolution in the
1920's and 30's - first began their work, the aims and scope of the theory had
not yet been decided upon. Arguably, even today, these aims are still being
negotiated. Debates among evolutionary biologists about the results, the role
and the limitations of population genetic theory fuel a significant part of the
disagreements in the evolution literature. Thus, it is useful to return to some
of the sources of these controversies. In the early 1900's the details of the
genetic bases of heredity, the relationship between the hereditary material and
observable variation, as well as which factors played a significant role in
evolution, and how these factors were related, were as yet unknown. Fisher,
Haldane and Wright were thus were defining a discipline, reacting to the
Darwinian Biometrical and Mendelian schools that came before them, and bringing
to bear their own notions of what kinds of problems required solution and how to
picture evolution in populations. Many of the questions they sought to answer
were beyond the scope of the available mathematics, many of their arguments were
verbal, or appealed to metaphor or analogy, and knowledge of the range of the
basic variables they treated was limited. Even today, empirical information on
the size of populations, migration rates, selective values, linkage arrangements
and inbreeding coefficients is incomplete. The object of this session will be a
philosophical examination of these three figures and their contribution to the
synthesis of Darwinism and Mendelism. There has been some controversy over what
the synthesis consisted in; clearly these very different men had different
conceptions of evolution. How then did their work lead to a synthesis, if at
all? Did they provide a &quot;unified&quot; explanation of evolution? Or, is it
better to think of these authors as founding a pluralistic tradition in
evolutionary theory? These are some of the questions we will examine.</p>

<p>Sewall Wright's adaptive landscape is one of the most influential heuristics
in the history of evolutionary biology. Wright's biographer, Provine, harshly
criticized Wright's adaptive landscape, claiming that its heuristic value is
dubious because of deep flaws. Ruse has defended Wright against Provine's
charges. Ruse claims that the landscape metaphor is heuristically valuable even
if Wright's version of it flawed and, anyway, Provine has not shown that
Wright's version of the metaphor is flawed. I argue that both Provine's and
Ruse's analyses of the adaptive landscape are defective and suggest a more
adequate understanding of the metaphor.</p>

Mathematics and the Role of the Individual&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Morrison">Margaret
Morrison</a> (University of Toronto)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>R.A. Fisher's work on the on the compatibility of Mendelism and Darwinism is
a brilliant application of mathematical and statistical techniques to
evolutionary theory. Fisher himself drew the analogy between the methodology in
his own work and statistical mechanics. Specifically he wanted to show that an
exact specification of individual factors relevant to the population was
unnecessary for arriving at a proper statistical analysis. When factors were
sufficiently numerous the most general assumptions with respect to individual
peculiarities would lead to the same statistical result. In gas theory it was
possible to &quot;make the most varied assumptions as to accidental
circumstances, and even the essential nature of the individual molecules, and
yet develop general laws as to the behaviour of gases, leaving but a few
fundamental constants to be determined by experiment&quot; (Fisher, 1922). So
too with biological populations. One needed only general statistical laws about
the interactions among genes rather than specific knowledge of biological
individuals in order to determine the effects of evolutionary mechanisms. Mayr
(1982) and other biologists have criticized the founders of mathematical
population genetics for oversimplifying, for the sake of mathematical
tractability, the factors that enter into the computations. The notion of a
'population' used by Fisher and even Pearson before him is thought to be not
only essentialist but unable to take account of the individual in biological
explanations. In this paper I examine the various ways in which the notion of an
'individual' is represented in the work of Fisher as well as in the biometric
methods of Karl Pearson. I argue that it was only by neglecting certain aspects
of individuals that Fisher was successful in showing how selection operated in
Mendelian populations. Hence, instead of being considered as defects, the
criticisms levied by Mayr against Fisher turn out to be the very source of his
overwhelming success.</p>

<a href="../program_authors.htm#Plutynski">Anya
Plutynski</a> (University of Utah)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The recent literature in philosophy of biology and philosophy of science more
generally has drawn attention to the pluralism of biological explanation - we
have explanations at different levels or units of selection, micro- and macro-
explanations, molecular, biomedical, and evolutionary explanations. Do these
explanations all have a common structure or end? The object of this paper will
be to investigate whether there are a plurality of types or kinds of explanation
in biology, and in particular, in the field of theoretical population genetics.
Part of this will involve examining the presuppositions of different founders of
theoretical population genetics - Fisher, Haldane and Wright - about the object
of explanation and what most requires explaining. Further, this investigation
into explanatory pluralism in population genetics will help to answer questions
about whether and how we ought to regard evolutionary theory as a
&quot;unified&quot; discipline. I will argue that the different explanations
they offered had to do with their competing ideals of what a science of
evolution would be, as well as their different presuppositions about the object
of inquiry.</p>

<p>This paper analyzes the development of evolutionary theory in the period from
1918 to 1932. It argues that: (i) Fisher’s work in 1918 constitutes a not
fully satisfactory reduction of biometry to Mendelism; (ii) that there was a
synthesis in the 1920s but that this synthesis was mainly one of classical
genetics with population genetics, with Haldane’s Causes of Evolution being
its founding document; (iii) the most important achievement of the models of
theoretical population genetics was to show that natural selection sufficed as a
mechanism for evolution; (iv) Haldane formulated a prospective evolutionary
theory in the 1920s whereas Fisher and Wright formulated retrospective theories
of evolutionary history; and (v) in the context of the history of evolutionary
biology, the differences between Fisher, Haldane, and Wright are as important as
their similarities.</p>
