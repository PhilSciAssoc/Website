<h1 align="left"><a name="36W"></a><i>Structuralist Approaches to Quantum
Gravity</i> (Workshop)</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">In recent years there has been
growing interest in the philosophical foundations of quantum gravity (as
evidenced by the Callendar and Huggett volume, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Physics Meets Philosophy at the Planck Scale</i>, as well as the recent
one day conference, ‘Philosophical Reflections on Quantum Gravity’ (July 4<sup>th</sup>,
2001), at the University of Leeds, to give just two recent examples). As is well
known, the construction of such a theory faces a number of deep-rooted problems
in effectively 'bringing together' quantum theory, with its presupposed fixed
space-time background, and general relativity, understood as a theory of
(dynamical) space-time structure. One can approach these problems from various
directions, not only from those of the differing perspectives of quantum and
relativistic physics, but also those that might be described as broadly
philosophical and physical. <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Thus one approach in the field
proceeds through the construction of some kind of background independent quantum
theory of cosmology. Baez, for example, has argued that background free quantum
theories such as topological quantum field theory suggest an important analogy
between the mathematics of space-time and the mathematics of quantum physics.
This analogy cam then be made precise using the tools of higher-dimensional
algebra and category theory in particular. As Baez points out, a further
obstacle to such developments concerns our understanding of the notion of causal
structure within this context. This is an issue which has been addressed by
Smolin who has further explored various features of the framework of a
background independent quantum theory of cosmology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Proceeding from the perspective
of General Relativity, another mode of entry into these issues is to focus on
the nature of general covariance in order to understand the sense in which
space-time is treated as dynamical. This raises the attendant issue of the
ontological status of space-time points and on this issue, of course,
philosophers of physics have been particularly active. Stachel, in particular,
has argued that the infamous hole argument is invalid in cases where the
individuality of space-time points is conferred by the relational structure of
space-time. Adopting the kind of structuralist framework this approach suggests
raises the possibility of being able to side-step the
substantivalist-relationist debate and develop a new perspective on the spatio-temporal
foundations of quantum gravity. Again, the most convenient mathematical
framework for such a structuralist perspective would be category theory and here
at Leeds we have been exploring the different ways these various frameworks and
perspectives intersect.</p>

aim of this symposium is to bring philosophically-minded physicists and
philosophers of physics together to both map out the current terrain and suggest
new avenues for future exploration.</p>

EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Structural realism emphasises (mathematical)
structures of scientific theories as representing the unobservable part of
reality. This position dovetails well with much of the recent work in canonical
quantum gravity, and in this paper we consider the work of Baez, Smolin et al.
from this perspective. After giving a brief introduction / independent
motivation to structural realism, we consider how a metaphysical notion of
structure appropriate to structural realism meshes with the more intuitive
notions of theoretical / spacetime structures used in this branch of quantum
gravity program. It is suggested that the mode of reasoning embraced in the
field is highly consonant with that recommended by structural realism, and some
possible ramifications of adopting structural realism as an appropriate
background philosophy to further research in this field are considered.</span></p>

mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">After discussing various versions of &quot;structural realism,&quot; I opt
for a version in which the fundamental physical entities of various kinds and
their relations are taken to be real. While these entities have &quot;quiddity&quot;(a
basic nature), reasons are given for assuming that they lack &quot;haeccity&quot;
(inherent individuality), and that all properties that do not inhere in their
nature are relational. Mathematical techniques for implementing this viewpoint
in a physical theory are discussed, and various formalisms that have been used
in the attempt to set up a theory (or theories) of quantum gravity are evaluated
on the basis of this criterion.</span></p>

mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">A general framework for quantum theories of gravity
which is independent of any classical background spacetime has been worked out
over the last 15 years. Known as
loop quantum gravity, this framework was derived originally for quantum general
relativity but it can be extended to a large class of theories including
supergravity theories and plausibly candidates for unified theories such as
string theories. We describe the basic structure of these theories, with
attention given to issues of interest for philosophers of science such as the
relational/absolute debate and the interpretation of quantum theory and quantum
cosmology.</span></p>

mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">The problems of quantum gravity suggest that we need a
new mathematical language which exhibits the common ground between our usual
ways of talking about space and time in general relativity and our usual ways of
talking about states and operators in quantum mechanics.
I argue that this language is already being developed by mathematicians
working on higher-dimensional algebra --- or more specifically, the theory of
`n-categories with duals'. While
still in its infancy, this theory already clarifies how some famously puzzling
features of quantum mechanics are closely akin to some not-at-all-puzzling
features of spacetime. If there is
time, I will also describe some work on theories of quantum gravity formulated
using higher-dimensional algebra.</p>
