<h2><a name="172"></a><b>&quot;The Structuralist Conception of Objects&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>This paper explores the consequences of the two most prominent forms of
contemporary structural realism for the notion of objecthood. Epistemic
structuralists hold that we can know structural aspects of reality, but nothing
about the natures of the relata whose relations define structures. Ontic
structuralists hold that we can know structural aspects of reality, and that
there is nothing else to know - objects are useful heuristic posits, but are
ultimately ontologically dispensable. I argue that neither of these forms of
structuralism succeed in ridding a structuralist ontology of objects. What
structural realism implies is not that objects do not exist, but rather that
objects should be understood structurally. The question of how we get from the
&quot;nodes&quot; of detected structures to a conception of objecthood may have
different answers, depending on the putative objects and problems under
investigation. Scientific developments shed light on the ontological natures of
particulars, but objects in general comprise a heterogeneous kind.</p>

<p>This paper is divided into two parts. The first part presents one of Bertrand
Russell`s lesser-known epistemological views, viz. `structural realism` (SR). In
short, this position holds that at most we have knowledge of the structure of
the external (i.e. physical) world. This is followed by an exposition of M.H.A.
Newman`s allegedly fatal objection that SR is either trivial or false. The
second part starts with a brief mention of the current state of SR. Appealing to
Quine`s notion of ontological relativity, the author argues that SR is
impervious to Newman`s objection for it is neither trivial nor false.</p>

Theory&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Lyons">Timothy

<p>Scientific realists have claimed that the posit that our theories are
(approximately) true provides the best or the only explanation for their success
. In response, I revive two non-realists explanations. I show that realists, in
discarding them, have either misconstrued the phenomena to be explained or
mischaracterized the relationship between these explanations and their own. I
contend nonetheless that these non-realist competitors, as well as their realist
counterparts, should be rejected; for none of them succeed in explaining a
significant list of successes. I propose a related non-realist explanation of
success that appears to be the most suitable among those considered.</p>

Revisiting Caloric&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Chang">Hasok

<p>Against Laudan`s &quot;pessimistic induction&quot;, a popular and plausible
response has been what I call &quot;preservative realism&quot;, which argues
that there have actually been enough elements of scientific knowledge preserved
through processes of major theory-changes, and that those elements can be
accepted realistically. This paper argues against preservative realism, in
particular through a critical review of Psillos`s argument concerning the case
of the caloric theory of heat. The historical record of the caloric theory
reveals that beliefs about the properties of material caloric were indeed
central to the successes of the caloric theory, contrary to Psillos`s argument.
Therefore caloric remains a favorable case for Laudan. Further, I argue that
even confirmed cases of preservation do not warrant an inference to truth.</p>

and the History of Science&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Stanford">P.

<p>Realists respond to Laudan's Pessimistic Induction with what I call the
selective confirmation strategy: arguing that only idle parts of past theories
have been rejected, while truly success-generating features have been confirmed
by further inquiry. I argue first that this strategy is unconvincing without
some prospectively applicable criterion of idleness for theoretical posits, and
second, that existing efforts to provide one either convict all theoretical
posits of idleness (Kitcher) or stand refuted by detailed consideration of the
very examples (optical/electromagnetic ether, caloric fluid) to which they
appeal (Psillos). Additionally, available avenues for improving on these
proposals are unpromising.</p>
