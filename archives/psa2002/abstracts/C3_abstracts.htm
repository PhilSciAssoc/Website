<h2><a name="113"></a><b>&quot;The Constructible and the Intelligible in Newton’s
Philosophy of Geometry&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Domski">Mary

<p>In the Preface to the Principia (1687) Newton famously states that “geometry
is founded on mechanical practice”. Several commentators have taken this and
similar remarks as an indication that Newton was firmly situated in the
constructivist tradition of geometry that was prevalent in the seventeenth
century. By drawing on a selection of Newton’s unpublished texts, I hope to
show the faults of such an interpretation. In these texts, Newton not only
rejects the constructivism that took its birth in Descartes’ Géométrie
(1637); he also presents the science of geometry as being more powerful than his
Principia remarks may lead us to believe.</p>

<h2><a name="67"></a><b>&quot;Motivational Realism: The Natural Classification
for Pierre Duhem&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Darling">Karen

<p>This paper addresses a central interpretive problem in understanding Pierre
Duhem`s philosophy of science. The problem arises because there is textual
support for both realist and antirealist readings of his work. I argue that his
realist and antirealist claims are different. For Duhem, scientific reasoning
leads straight to antirealism. But intuition (reasons of the heart) motivates,
without justifying, a kind of realism. I develop this idea to suggest a
motivational realist interpretation of Duhem`s philosophy.</p>

<h2><a name="131"></a><b>&quot;Francis Bacon`s Philosophy of Science: machina
intellectus and forma indita&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Muntersbjorn">Madeline

<p>Francis Bacon (1561-1626) wrote that good scientists are not like ants
(mindlessly gathering data) or spiders (spinning empty theories). Instead, they
are like bees, transforming nature into a nourishing product. This essay
examines Bacon`s &quot;middle way&quot; by elucidating the means he proposes to
turn experience and insight into understanding. The human intellect relies on
&quot;machines&quot; to extend perceptual limits, check impulsive imaginations,
and reveal nature`s latent causal structure, or &quot;forms.&quot; This
constructivist interpretation is not intended to supplant inductivist or
experimentalist interpretations, but is designed to explicate Bacon`s account of
science as a collaborative project with several interdependent methodological
goals.</p>

<h2><a name="159"></a><b>&quot;Defending Conventions as Functionally A Priori
Knowledge&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Stump">David
J. Stump</a> (University of San Francisco)&nbsp;<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/documents/disk0/00/00/10/99/index.html" target="_top"><font size="2">[full

<p>Recent defenses of a priori knowledge can be applied to the idea of
conventions in science in order to indicate one important sense in which
conventionalism is correct-some elements of physical theory have a unique
epistemological status as a constitutive part of our physical theory. I will
argue that the former a priori should be treated as empirical in a very abstract
sense, but still conventional. Though actually coming closer to the Quinean
position than the standard treatments of conventionalism, the picture of
knowledge developed here is very different from that developed in Quinean holism
in that categories of knowledge can be differentiated.</p>
