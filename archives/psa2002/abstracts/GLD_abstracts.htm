<p>In this paper I will consider critically, and I hope constructively, Stephen
Gould's views on &quot;historical contingency,&quot; together with ongoing
efforts to &quot;test&quot; his views. Evaluating his position is less than
straightforward for a couple of reasons. First, Gould articulated his position
on contingency in two very different ways, without acknowledging that he was
doing so. Moreover, in the process of evaluating his position(s), evolutionary
biologists have not made it clear which of the two versions of contingency they
are addressing.</p>
