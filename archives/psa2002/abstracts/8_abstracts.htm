<h1 align="left"><a name="8"></a><i>The Epistemology of Thought Experiments</i>
(Symposium)</h1>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>What is the origin and nature of scientific knowledge? This
question is of fundamental importance to philosophy of science. Over the
millennia there have been many competing answers to the question. How are we
know which are the stronger answers? The new debate over thought experiments
offers us a way.</p>
<p>Thought experiments are one of the most remarkable
instruments of scientific writing. A scientist—a Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Mach
or Einstein—presents us some pressing matter in science to resolve. We are
uncertain of the resolution. The scientist conjures up an experiment purely in
thought. We follow its development, replicating it in our thought. When it is
concluded, our uncertainty is gone. We know the resolution and sense that
somehow we knew it all along.</p>
<p>The transformation is compelling and apparently miraculous.
New knowledge appears from simple introspection. Any account of the origin and
nature of scientific knowledge must be able to accommodate it. It is a telling
test case. Others tests may require abstruse technicalia or obscure historical
detail. The power of thought experiments is that the basic phenomena are known
to us all first hand. While some thought experiments may require specialist
knowledge, many are by design accessible to a broad group; and everyone has a
favorite thought experiment in which the grand result leaps unexpectedly onto
the stage.</p>
<p>Over the last decade and a half, there has arisen a new
literature over the epistemology of thought experiments. The four participants
in the symposium proposed are principal proponents of viewpoints that span the
range of possible positions. Norton and Brown each defend what are the extremes
of the traditional empiricist-rationalist axis. Norton's view is deflationary.
Pure thought, he urges, can give us no more knowledge that we already have. It
can only reorganize what we already know and it must do so by the only truth-
(or probability-) preserving vehicle we know, argumentation. Brown however feels
that empiricist epistemologies cannot do justice to the manifest power to some
thought experiments to bring us new knowledge. No simple adjustment to these
epistemologies could ever do justice to that power. We must seek a radical
source: we learn from thought experiments when they allow our introspection to
access the laws of nature in the
Platonic world of forms.</p>
<p>While many intermediate positions and new axes are
possible, two are explored by Gendler and McAllister. Gendler urges that thought
experiments lead us to new knowledge by prompting a reconfiguration of internal
conceptual space: contemplation of imaginary particulars may lead us to
introduce novel categories for making sense of previously unsystematized
beliefs. Such a view differs from Brown's rationalism in denying that such
reconfiguations require appeal to platonic perceptual capacities; it differs
from Norton's empiricism in rejecting argumentation as the sole source of
truth-preservation.</p>
<p>McAllister argues that the approaches of the other
contributors neglect the historical dimension of scientific practice. In his
view, thought experiments are not self-evidently valid or universally applicable
devices. Rather, the evidential significance of thought experiments depends on
our subscribing to Galileo's view that science aims at uncovering phenomena, and
that experience of events is a poor source of knowledge about phenomena. Whereas
thought experiments arise out of fundamentally empiricist concerns, therefore,
they embody a mistrust of experience. In domains of science inspired by Galilean
physics, thought experiments constitute a valid approach to uncovering laws of
nature; in other domains, they are assigned no evidential significance.</p>
<h3>Why Now and Why This?</h3>
<p>Why have this symposium now? While thought experiments were on the PSA
program 10 years ago, this is the first symposium that would target the
epistemological problems quite narrowly. There are so many other issues
pertaining to thought experiments—literary, cognitive and rhetorical, for
example—that it has proven all too easy to raise the hard epistemological
questions and sidestep them. We will not do this. Indeed the four of us have
been engaged in deep and long-standing debate that extends over a decade and a
half. Yet we have never met in a public forum to debate face to face. This will
be the first time!</p>

<p>Naturalism and empiricism are overwhelmingly dominant. They do an adequate job in many areas of knowledge, but seem to fall
short in fields such as ethics and mathematics. They also fall short in central parts of natural science.
There are some thought experiments, I will argue, that cannot be
adequately reconstructed along empiricist lines.
To show this is to show (for the most part), that the empiricist
reconstructions of John Norton leave crucial aspects of some thought experiments
out of the account. It is to show,
in other words, that there are some things traditional rationalists and
platonists got right — a priori
knowledge of nature is indeed possible. In
addition to discussing thought experiments in the natural sciences, I want to
extend what we have learned from them into the realm of mathematics.
The aim is to show that some visualizations can yield remarkable
findings, results that are just as rigorous as standard derivations. It is even possible (following Freiling’s work) that the Continuum
Hypothesis could be settled with this approach. But even if not, we still can learn much about the existence of tools for
acquiring knowledge that greatly transcend our feeble empirical methods.</p>

<p>I will defend what I call a <i>constructivist</i> account of thought
experiments. According to such an account, it is by causing us to contemplate
particular imaginary scenarios that thought experiments gain their epistemic
force--a force sufficient to provide us with true beliefs that
are both novel and justified. The novelty of the beliefs results from our
considering familiar phenomena in light of a new conceptual framework; their
justification results from our gaining propositional access to previously
unarticulated knowledge. In my symposium talk, I will lay out the principal
claims and consequences of this view, contrasting
it with the views of James Robert Brown, John Norton, and James W. McAllister.</p>

 <h2><a name="8C"></a><b>&quot;Thought Experiments and the Belief in
 Phenomena&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#McAllister">James
 McAllister</a> (University of Leiden)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Thought experiments acquire evidential significance only under particular
metaphysical assumptions. These include the thesis that science aims at
uncovering &quot;phenomena&quot;, universal and stable modes into which the
world is articulated, and the thesis that actual occurrences reveal phenomena
imperfectly. Only under these Platonically inspired assumptions does it make
sense to attempt to bypass experience of actual occurrences and perform thought
experiments. These assumptions are taken to hold in post-Galilean physics, but
not in sciences that emphasize contingency, such as Aristotelian physics and
present-day human sciences. This explains why thought experiments carry weight
in the former but not the latter disciplines.</p>
