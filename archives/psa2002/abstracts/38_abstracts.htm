<h1 align="left"><a name="38"></a><i>David Lewis`s Contributions to Philosophy
of Science</i> (Symposium)</h1>
<p>David K. Lewis died on October 14, 2001. He was one of the greatest
systematic thinkers of the twentieth century, making significant contributions
in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and more. This symposium
intends to honor his seminal work in philosophy of science. This work includes,
but is not limited to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A development of Ramsey's idea about theoretical terms </li>
  <li>Humean accounts of laws, chance, counterfactuals, and causation </li>
  <li>An account of causal decision theory </li>
  <li>An account of modality and trans-world individuation (counterpart theory)
    that has consequences for quantum mechanics (identical particles) and
    space-time theories (the hole argument) </li>
  <li>An objective account of explanation (causal explanation) </li>
  <li>A paper, his last, on the interpretation of quantum mechanics </li>
  <li>Account of the relationship between subjective and objective probabilities
  </li>
  <li>Account of fundamental natural properties </li>
  <li>Account of conditional probability and probability of conditionals</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, the content of this symposium cannot reflect all of the work Lewis
has done. It strives instead to display the vitality of his ideas in the work of
active philosophers of science. Due to the closeness of his death to the
symposium proposal date, detailed abstracts and titles of the papers in the
symposium are not yet available. However, familiarity with the topic, the work
of Lewis and the speaker should still give those on the Program Committee enough
information with which to work.</p>

<p>I commemorate David Lewis by describing some of the modal involvements of
analytical mechanics. After a review of the Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and
Hamilton-Jacobi approaches, I discuss two modal involvements; both are related
to Lewis' work on modality, especially on counterfactuals. The first is the way
Hamilton-Jacobi theory uses ensembles, i.e. sets of possible initial conditions.
The second is the way the variational principles mention contralegal dynamical
evolutions.</p>

<p>As part of his defense of Humean Supervenience David Lewis sketched an
actualist account of fundamental chances. I develop the account and show that
that in many ways it is superior to actual frequency, modal frequency, and
propensity accounts. I discuss its relation to &quot;the Principal
Principle&quot; and how it can help with the long standing problem of making
sense of probabilities over initial conditions.</p>
