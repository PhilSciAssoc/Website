(Symposium)</h1>
<p>Bayesian networks are the generalized nonlinear versions of Sewall Wright's
path models. Bayes nets have gained ground in the artificial intelligence and
business communities for their ability to represent and compute efficiently the
probabilistic dependencies necessary for reasoning under uncertainty. What makes
Bayes nets most compelling however is their close connection with causal
inference and causation.</p>
<p>Following Judea Pearl's advances in the graph-theoretic underpinnings of
probabilistic independence, researchers at CMU, UCLA, Monash, Microsoft, and a
few other centers have developed algorithms for reasoning about and representing
causality and causal manipulation using Bayes nets, and for automatically
inferring causal structure from statistical data using the constraints implied
by graph theory. The best known program for automated causal inference may be
CMU's TETRAD II.</p>
<p>More recently, Clark Glymour has teamed up with Patricia Cheng and Alison
Gopnik and by applying Bayes nets they have drastically improved psychological
theories of human causal inference and causal reasoning. Working in parallel,
researchers at Stanford have shown how human causal inference can be modeled as
Bayesian inference about Bayesian networks.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting for philosophers, Pearl's recent book Causality
builds on the insight from both his research team and that at CMU and engages
the philosophical literature on causation with surprising insights about not
only type causation but token causation and causal processes.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Bayes nets provide a much more powerful representation
for reasoning about causation than is commonly used in philosophy. While a few
philosophers from Herbert Simon to Nancy Cartwright, Clark Glymour, Paul
Humphries, and Gurol Irzik have been urging us to use path models all along, the
full theory of probabilistic independency was not worked out until the mid-80s,
and only more recently has the causal interpretation of Bayes nets been set out
reasonably clearly.</p>
<p>The purpose of this seminar is to bring together leading researchers in
Bayesian networks, drawn from philosophy, computer science, and artificial
intelligence and attempt to arrive at some consensual understanding of the
difficulties, insights and opportunities for Bayesian networks offer to
philosophers of causation.</p>

<p>Bayes nets are a powerful tool for causal inference. But they treat causality
as a single monolithic notion. Recent work on counterfactuals by Judea Pearl and
by students of Daria Lewis go some way to providing different tests appropriate
to different types of causation. This paper will explore to what extent these
attempts are successful and how they can be extended and improved on.</p>

Processes&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Menzies">Peter

<p>Graphical models have traditionally been used in the social sciences and
artificial intelligence to characterize type-causation or general causation.
However, Judea Pearl in Chapter 10 of his book 'Causality' (CUP, 2000) has
advanced a theory of token-causation, or actual causation as he calls it, based
on the graphical models approach. Pearl introduces the notions of sustenance and
a causal beam to capture the notion of a process that seems to be central to
commonsense intuitions about token-causation. </p>
<p>In this paper I compare Pearl's graphical models approach to token-causation
with other philosophical approaches -in particular, quasi-dependence and
functionalist theories-that highlight the role of intrinsic processes and
relations in judgements about token-causation. I examine the strengths and
weaknesses of Pearl's approach in comparison with these other approaches by
considering examples of pre-emption (early and late, preventive and
non-preventive), symmetrical overdetermination, and trumping.</p>

When Can We Know It?&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../program_authors.htm#Spirtes">Peter

<p>The point of many statistical studies is to guide policy. Good guidance to
policy makers requires making reliable predictions about what the effects of
some policy would be, if it were to be adopted; this in turn requires at least
partial knowledge about causal relationships among variables. Many policies are
implemented by forcing a value on a random variable V (e.g. changing the amount
of use of a medical drug that has been found to be dangerous by banning it from
the market). In that case we will say that V has been manipulated. The
fundamental question that I will address is &quot;To what extent is it
theoretically possible to predict the effects of a manipulation from
observational samples and background knowledge of various kinds?&quot; I will
present a variety of recent results, some positive, and some negative, about the
possibility of converging to correct predictions about the effects of
manipulations, under a variety of senses of convergence (e.g. pointwise or
uniform, etc.) and a variety of different background assumptions. (This is joint
work with Jamie Robins, Larry Wasserman, Richard Scheines and Clark Glymour.)</p>

<p>The causal Markov condition says roughly that, conditional on its direct
causes, a variable is probabilistically independent of everything except its
effects. This condition is one of the basic building blocks for Bayes-nets
modeling of causation. But little has been said concerning why this condition
should generally hold. We explore the extent to which the causal Markov
condition can be justified as a probabilistic manifestation of a
&quot;control&quot; or &quot;manipulation&quot; view of causation. The condition
will be justified to the extent that conditioning on the direct causes of X
mimics the effect of an intervention on X.</p>
