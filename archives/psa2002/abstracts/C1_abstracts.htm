<p>Biological research on race has often been seen as motivated by or lending
credence to underlying racist attitudes; in part for this reason, recently
philosophers and biologists have gone through great pains to essentially deny
the existence of biological human races. We argue that human races, in the
biological sense of local populations adapted to particular environments, do in
fact exist; such races are best understood through the common ecological concept
of ecotypes. However, human ecotypic races do not in general correspond with
`folk` racial categories, largely because many similar ecotypes have multiple
independent origins. Consequently, while human natural races exist, they have
little or nothing in common with `folk` races.</p>

<p>Race is a prominent category in medicine. Epidemiologists describe how rates
of morbidity and mortality vary with race, and doctors consider the race of
their patients when deciding whether to test them for sickle cell anemia or what
drug to use to treat their hypertension. At the same time, critics of racial
classification say that race is not real but only an illusion or that race is
scientifically meaningless. In this paper, I explain how race is used in
medicine as a proxy for genes that encode drug metabolizing enzymes and how a
proper understanding of race calls into doubt the practice of treating race as a
marker of any medically relevant genetic trait.</p>

<p>When is Biology Destiny? Biological Determinism and Social Responsibility
Abstract I argue here that critics of biological explanations of human nature
are mistaken when they maintain that the truth of genetic determinism implies
the end of critical evaluation and reform of our social institutions. Such claim
erroneously presupposes that our social values, practices, and institutions have
nothing to do with what makes biological explanations troublesome. What
constitutes a problem for those who are concerned with social justice is not the
fact that particular behaviors might be genetically determined, but the fact
that our value system and social institutions create the conditions that make
such behaviors problematic.</p>

<p>Experimental ‘localism’ stresses the importance of context-specific
knowledge, and the limitations of universal theories in science. I illustrate
Latour’s radical approach to localism and show that it has some unpalatable
consequences, in particular the suggestion that problems of external validity
(or how to generalise experimental results to non-laboratory circumstances)
cannot be solved. In the last part of the paper I try to sketch a solution to
the problem of external validity by extending Mayo’s error-probabilistic
approach.</p>
