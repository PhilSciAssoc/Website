<h1 align="left"><a name="12"></a><i>Realization and Explanation in Neuroscience</i>
(Symposium)</h1>
<p>Neuroscience has experienced explosive growth over the last 30 years.
Membership in the Society for Neuroscience has increased from 500 in 1970 to
35,000 at present, and the field now rests on a bedrock of theoretical advances
in understanding the chemical, electrical and physiological workings of the
central nervous system. Yet the philosophy of science has largely ignored
neuroscience. This is unfortunate since, first, there is considerable overlap
between issues in the philosophy of neuroscience and issues in the philosophy of
biology (much of neuroscience is, after all, biology) and, second, neuroscience
offers unique puzzles resulting from its (partial) focus on questions of the
mind. In an effort to develop bridges between the philosophy of neuroscience and
the philosophy of science generally, we propose a session on realization and
explanation in neuroscience.</p>
<p>It is frequently said that cognitive states and processes are
&quot;realized&quot; in the mechanisms of the brain. The notion of
&quot;realization&quot; was originally introduced by Putnam to describe the
relationship between the &quot;logical&quot; and the &quot;structural&quot;
states of a computer. He later wielded the notion as part of a multiple
realizability argument against type-type reduction generally. This latter
argument has become a centerpiece of discussions of reductionism and
antireductionism in both the philosophy of mind and in the philosophy of
biology.</p>
<p>The notion of realization has also assumed a central place in discussions of
the status of higher-level generalizations in the so-called &quot;special
sciences&quot;. For many, the legitimacy of higher-level causal claims hinges
upon the existence of lower-level realizers. Thus Stuart Glennan (1996) has
argued that to say that one thing causes another (except for lowest level causal
relations governed by direct causal laws) just is to say that the relation
between them is realized by a mechanism linking cause and effect. Similar
positions have been endorsed in the philosophy of neuroscience by Bill Bechtel,
Terry Horgan, Ernest Lepore and Barry Loewer (1989) and Jaegwan Kim (see, e.g.,
1995, 197). For many of these philosophers, the notion of
&quot;realization&quot; ads much needed bite to logical notions of &quot;supervenience&quot;
and thus becomes a crucial component in spelling out a robust form of
physicalism.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, there is almost no consensus (or even, until quite
recently, discussion) as to what it takes for one entity, state or process to
realize another, about how philosophical and scientific senses of realization
are related to one another, or about how the goal of discovering &quot;realizers&quot;
shapes scientific practice. These are the questions to be addressed in our
session. Craver develops an account of &quot;realization&quot; from his work on
mechanisms and then uses it to criticize an argument by V.S. Ramachandran (the
Oliver Sachs of the 90's) for the nonexistence of selves. Wilson compares such
mechanistic accounts of realization to more metaphysical approaches, arguing
that an emphasis on the former tends to reinforce unhealthy localistic biases in
contemporary neuroscientific research. Von Eckardt disagrees, arguing that
metaphysical approaches to realization have little to say about the notion of
realization that is commonplace in neuroscientific research and so ought to be
abandoned in favor of a more scientifically adequate notion. Polger, finally,
uses Marr's theory of early visual processing to argue that a metaphysically
robust notion of realization is necessary to assess the adequacy of physicalism
in contemporary neuroscience.</p>

F. Craver</a> (Washington University)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Recent work on the character of mechanisms and of mechanistic levels provides
the basis for an account of one sort of realization relation common in
neuroscience. In neuroscientific theories, roles (R) are typically realized by
mechanisms (M). This realization relation has three parts: the context C within
which M realizes R, the &quot;input-output&quot; relation by which M realizes R,
and the organized activities of the entities composing M by virtue of which M
maintains that input-output relation. This account of realization provides
leverage to answer three questions: (i) What are the identity conditions of Rs?
(ii) What are the identity conditions of Ms? and (iii) How are the identity
conditions for M's and R's related to one another? These questions are raised in
the context of the neurologist V.S. Ramachandran's recent attempt to argue that
&quot;the self is a fiction&quot; on the grounds that what we call &quot;the
self&quot; is in fact realized by several distinct neural mechanisms. I claim,
on the basis of the above account of realization and the resulting take on
identity conditions, that Ramachandran's argument is deeply flawed (even if his
conclusion may be largely correct).</p>

<p>The aim of this paper is to explore, first, the merits of the mechanism
approach in the philosophy of biology for understanding explanation in cognitive
neuroscience and, second, the scope and limits of cognitive neuroscience itself
for understanding human psychology. We shall argue that the mechanism approach,
as one would expect, can capture the mechanistic aspects of cognitive
neuroscientific models quite well but cannot capture content-related aspects.
Furthermore, despite its promise, there are aspects of cognition and behavior
that cognitive neuroscience cannot explain, specifically, those involving the
social environment. Both these points become evident when one considers cases of
psychopathology.</p>

<p>Realization has remained a much used and seldom analyzed concept in the
philosophy of psychology and, to a lesser extent, the philosophy of biology, at
least until the recent appearance of a flurry of papers (e.g., Bechtel and
Mundale 1999; Craver 2001; Lyons 2001; Wilson 2001). After some discussion of
the differences between the more metaphysically-rarified and the more
mechanistically-driven strands of these discussions, this paper focuses on the
relationship between realization (or implementation) and a variety of localistic
biases in contemporary research in the neurosciences. William Uttal (2001) has
issued a caution about the &quot;new phrenology&quot; thriving in current
imaging-driven research, particularly in cognitive neuroscience, and this paper
will pick up on some of these concerns, relating them to recent
mechanistically-driven strands in the discussion of realization.</p>

<p>The view that the relationship between minds and brains can be thought of on
the model of software and hardware is pervasive. The most common versions of the
view, known as functionalism in philosophy of mind, hold that minds are realized
by brains. The question arises, How do brains realize minds? I approach the
question of realization through a case study: David Marr's (1982) computational
account of early visual processing. Marr's work is instructive because it is,
quite literally, a textbook case of the hierarchy of mechanisms that has seemed
to bear out the arguments of functionalist philosophers and cognitive
scientists.</p>
