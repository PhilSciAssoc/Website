<h1 align="left"><a name="33W"></a><i>Causation and Explanation in Chemistry</i>
(Workshop)</h1>
<p>The philosophical study of any special science must center on the structures
and categories appearing in its explanations. In its explanations of the
reactivity and spectroscopic behavior of chemical species, modern chemistry is
closely associated with the appeal to atomic and molecular structures. The roots
of this explanatory tradition lie in the nineteenth century, which saw the
emergence of the periodic table as well as an array of hypothetical molecular
structures put to use in explaining chemical combination. In the twentieth
century, this heritage was consolidated in two ways. Firstly, chemical structure
theory was elaborated into a vast body of dynamical reaction mechanisms and a
distinct tradition of visual representation and explanation. Secondly, the
emergence of the interdisciplinary fields of chemical physics and quantum
chemistry brought deeper physical insight to chemical explanations. Put
together, these nineteenth and twentieth century developments raise a number of
issues worthy of philosophical attention. </p>
<p>The first group of issues concerns the depth and quality of explanations
provided by the early twentieth century unifications of chemical and physical
theory. To assess these explanations, understanding late nineteenth century
chemistry is very important. Many nineteenth century chemists were skeptical
about the explanatory status of atoms and molecules. It is usually assumed that
these doubts were assuaged (except on the part of some stubborn individuals) by
microstructural explanations of optical isomerism and the law of constant
proportions. However, there were genuine reasons to doubt the quality of these
and related explanations well into the twentieth century. This is especially
interesting given the frequency with which philosophers cite nineteenth-century
atomism as a canonical example of inference to the best explanation. </p>
<p>One explanatory difficulty toward the close of the nineteenth century was the
presence of significant gaps and vagueness in the mechanisms invoked by atomic
explanations. For example, explanations of optical isomerism could account only
for the number of different isomers of a given empirical formula, a fact that
could also be accounted for by several other hypotheses. The details of how
plane-polarized light could be rotated by interaction with chiral molecules came
only much later. Similarly, early molecular explanations of the stoichiometry of
chemical reactions were devoid of mechanistic detail. At the same time,
opponents of atomism like Pierre Duhem could point to independent energetic
explanations of chemical change, explanations that posited no explanatorily idle
wheels. Thus, we believe that understanding exactly what the explanatory
successes of atomism were and when they were actually achieved is critical to
developing a sophisticated understanding of scientific explanation. </p>
<p>The second group of issues concerns the distinct tradition of explaining and
representing chemical change. Historians of science have documented the
development of this tradition in the nineteenth century, and the
twentieth-century emergence of the interdisciplinary field of quantum chemistry.
The persistence of chemical explanation in this new interdisciplinary field
brought intense methodological debate. Chemical advocates of quantum-mechanical
explanations of chemical bonding, like Linus Pauling and C.A. Coulson, sought to
persuade their skeptical chemical colleagues of the value of quantum-mechanical
models by tailoring these models to recover core explanatory features of
qualitative molecular theories. In contrast, prominent physicists like Max Born
emphasized the requirement that molecular quantum mechanics should preserve
theoretical rigor, even at the expense of radical revisions to central chemical
notions like valence and structure. Critics of this revisionism worried about
loss of explanatory power, while the revisionists worried that the
chemistryfriendly “models” of chemical bonding were ad hoc and simplistic.
It is easy to think of philosophical accounts of explanation that would favor
Born’s rigorous theoretical derivations on the one hand, or Pauling’s
intuitive models on the other. But can their disagreement be recovered as the
legitimate consequence of their differing disciplinary commitments? </p>
<p>Developments in computer modeling in the last thirty years have rendered
molecular models dynamic, predictive, and visually striking. New developments
have also sharpened the earlier disciplinary divide between theorists who work
on “qualitative theory’’ and those working on “quantitative theory.”
The distinction between one tradition of modeling (qualitative) that tries to be
explanatory and another (quantitative) that simply tries to be as accurate and
precise as possible poses important challenges to extant philosophical theories
of explanation. One challenge concerns the issue of truth. If explanantia are
taken to be more explanatory the closer they come to truth, how could highly
idealized “qualitative” models be more explanatory than highly accurate
quantitative ones? </p>
<p>Another issue raised by the development of quantum chemistry concerns the
role of causal concepts in chemistry. Throughout the twentieth century,
philosophers of science have suggested various ways to and motivations for
excising causal talk from science. Prima facie, quantum chemistry seems to
provide a new way to complete this project. Traditional chemical talk about “hydrolyzing,”
“bond breaking,” and “oxidizing,” might be replaced with elegant
mathematical models that are manipulated on powerful computers. Is there some
important role that causal talk plays in chemistry that even the most elegant
quantum mechanical model cannot replace? </p>
<p>We believe these topics represent some of the central, but underexplored,
areas of philosophy of chemistry. Understanding these topics will also help to
deepen our general accounts of explanation, causation, approximation and
scientific realism.</p>
