<center><b><font size=+1>The Short Guide to Vancouver Dining</font></b>
<p><font size=-1>Alan Richardson</font>
<p><font size=-1>Philosophy, UBC</font></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font size=-1>Unlike the last venue for the joint PSA/HSS meetings,
Vancouver does <i>not</i> have the two best restaurants in America. Instead
it has hundreds of excellent dining options. This short guide is meant
only to whet your appetite and give you a sense of the range of options.
It concentrates on city centre restaurants and those in nearby neighbourhoods,
since those will be the easiest restaurants for conference goers to get
to and from.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Before the dining options, a word about downtown Vancouver.
The Hyatt is at Burrard and Georgia, pretty well at the western edge of
downtown commercial district. Burrard is one of the main north-south streets,
and the commercial core is along the north-south streets just east of Burrard:
Howe, Granville, Seymour, over to Cambie. If you travel west from the Hyatt,
you find yourself in the more residential area of downtown, the downtown
West End.</font>
<p><b><font size=-1>Dining Options by Region</font></b>
<p><font size=-1>I will give a few salient options by region, first downtown
and then in other close-by neighbourhoods. There are many, many more options
in all areas.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The price code is: $ = entrees typically less than $10;
$$ = entrees typically $10-20; $$$ = entrees typically above $20. The assignment
of these codes to individual restaurants is not necessarily fully reliable.
My particular favourites are marked with an asterisk!</font>
<p><i><font size=-1>Downtown</font></i>
<p><font size=-1><b><u>The West End</u></b>: From the Hyatt, go south a
couple of blocks to Robson, the hippest shopping street downtown, and turn
west. Take Robson west to Denman and you are at the heart of the west end.
If you take Denman south to Davie, you’ll be at English Bay, looking out
over Kitsilano and Point Grey to the south. Just beyond Denman to the west
is Stanley Park, Vancouver’s green heart. The sea wall around Stanley Park
is a roughly 10k trip around the most beautiful urban park you’ll ever
be in, and there are some paths through the park that allow you to get
some sense of the size of the trees in BC’s old growth forests.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Along Robson, you’ll find, for example:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Zefferelli’s</b> (1136 Robson, 604.687.0655, $$), they’re
young, they’re hip, they’re eating Italian;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>CinCin</b> (1154 Robson, 604.688.7338, $$), a restaurant
for beautiful people;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Da Pasta Bar</b> (12332 Robson, 604.688.1288, $$),
an inexpensive but pretty good pasta restaurant.</font>
<p><font size=-1>On Denman, you’ll find, for example:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Caf&eacute; de Paris</b> (751 Denman, 604.687.1418,
$$), where excellent mussels and fries can be had for a reasonable price;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Nat’s New York Pizza</b> (1080 Denman; 604.642.0777,
$), the <i>only</i> pizza in Vancouver worth eating;</font>
<p><font size=-1>*<b>The Raincity Grill</b> (1193 Denman, 604.685.7337,
$$$), one of the leading Northwest cuisine restaurants, with a fabulous
wine list and a fabulous setting on English Bay.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Nearby, you’ll find, for example:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Bin 941</b> (943 Davie, 604.683.1246, $$), a leading
example of the current tapas craze.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b><u>Yaletown</u></b>: If you take Robson east instead,
and walk to Cambie, you’ll find yourself in one of the newest neighbourhoods
downtown, Yaletown. This is where beautiful people go to see and be seen.
There are some nice dining options in Yaletown, and maybe the best thing
about it is that the best downtown grocery stores are in Yaletown: the
pricey <b>Urban Fair</b> (177 Davie) and the somewhat less pricey<b> Choices</b>
(1202 Richards). Also, this is where Vancouver’s professional (?) sports
teams play.</font>
<p><font size=-1>On the way, you might want to stop at one of Vancouver’s
leading hotel restaurants:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>*Diva at the Met</b> (645 Howe Street in the Metropolitan
Hotel, 604.602.7788, reservations@divamet.com, $$$), on everyone’s list
of the best of Vancouver.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In Yaletown, you’ll find, for example,</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>The Yaletown Brewing Company</b> (1111 Mainland, 604.681.2739,
$$), one of the few brew pubs in Vancouver;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Villa Del Lupo</b> (869 Hamilton, 604.688.7436, $$$),
very fine Roman cuisine in a nice old house.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b><u>Gastown, Chinatown, and the Downtown Eastside</u></b>:
If you go north on Burrard to Cordova and then take Cordova east, you’ll
walk along the waterfront of the Port of Vancouver, and in about 15 minutes
you’ll get to Gastown at Water Street. Gastown is mainly a tourist area—an
excellent place to go if you have promised your kids t-shirts, maple syrup,
stuffed Mounties, or other Canadiana—but there are some good restaurants
and shops there. If you continue through Gastown to Carrall Street and
turn south and go up to Pender, you’ll be in Chinatown. Cheap and good
restaurants abound in Chinatown. Enjoy! Caution: East of Gastown and north
of Chinatown—centred on the infamous corner, Hastings and Main—is the so-called
Downtown Eastside, which some believe is Canada’s worst neighbourhood.
That is perhaps an over-statement but it is home of poverty, the sex trade,
injection drug use, and HIV/AIDS in Vancouver.</font>
<p><font size=-1>On the way:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Imperial Chinese Seafood Restaurant</b> (355 Burrard,
604.688.8191, $$$)–excellent Chinese in a beautiful waterfront room just
two blocks from the Hyatt.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In Gastown, you find, for example,</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>The Water Street Caf&eacute;</b> (300 Water Street,
604.689.2832, $$), good and reasonable.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>*The Raintree</b> (375 Water Street, 604.688.5570,
$$$), Pacific Northwest cuisine using only local ingredients. This is what
the Northwest tastes like.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Steamworks</b> (375 Water Street, 604.689.2739, $$),
in the same building as the Raintree, another of Vancouver’s brew pubs.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In Chinatown, there are so many reasonable ($-$$) and
interesting choices that I leave this to your whim.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b><u>North Granville</u></b>: Heading east on Georgia
for just a few blocks, you arrive at Granville, the main downtown drag.
If you head south on Granville, you will be in the heart of Vancouver’s
entertainment and arts district. The Vancouver Art Gallery is right at
Georgia and Granville. Most of the downtown cinemas are on Granville; the
Vancouver Symphony’s home is the Orpheum Theatre on Granville. The street
deteriorates as you head south, becoming a home for strip clubs, x-rated
bookstores, tattoo and body piercing shops, and funky, trashy stores catering
to teen-aged street kids. If you go all the way south on Howe or Homer
Streets (a couple of blocks west and east of Granville, respectively) you
can get to the northern banks of False Creek. Find the stop for the ferry
across False Creek—it takes one minute—and go to Vancouver’s public market,
the<b> Granville Island Market</b>. Excellent produce, bread, coffee, and
lunch!</font>
<p><font size=-1>Along the way, you might want to stop at:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Indigo Bistro Moderne</b> (1088 Burrard, 604.893.7150,
$$), in the Wall Centre Hotel;</font>
<p><b><font size=-1>The Wedgewood Hotel Restaurant</font></b><font size=-1>
(845 Hornby, 604.689.7777, $$$), known for its beef.</font>
<p><font size=-1>On the south end of downtown you can find, for example,</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>*C Restaurant</b> (1600 Howe; 604.681.1164, $$$), one
of Vancouver’s newer additions, specializing in seafood.</font>
<p><i><font size=-1>Beyond Downtown</font></i>
<p><font size=-1><b><u>Kitsilano and Point Grey</u></b>: If you go south
across the Burrard or Granville Bridges and head west on 4th Avenue or
Broadway, you are on the main streets of Kitsilano, first, and then Point
Grey. The University of British Columbia sits out on the very end of Point
Grey. Some of the best restaurants in Vancouver are on the way to UBC.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In Kitsilano, try these fine restaurants:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>*Bishop’s</b> (2183 W. 4th, 604.738.2025, $$$), the
standard against which all other restaurants in Vancouver are measured;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>*Quattro</b> (2611 W. 4th, 604.734.4444, $$$), have
the antipasto!;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>*Lumiere</b> (2551 W. Broadway, 604.739.8185, $$$),
the best French restaurant west of Montreal.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In Point Grey, you’ll find, for example:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Provence Mediterranean Grill</b> (4473 W. 10th, 604.222.1980,
$$$), also good French.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b><u>South Granville and Cambie</u></b>: If you head
south on over the Granville Bridge, you end up in the high-rent district
of South Granville. Here you’ll find some upmarket shops and some dining
options—also the Stanley Theatre. Heading south over the Cambie Bridge
brings you to south Cambie, a more funky area. Here there are some lower
priced options for dining. Between Granville and Cambie you’ll find City
Hall, Vancouver General Hospital, and thus also some dining options dedicated
to busy but prosperous professionals.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Some options in the neighbourhood are:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>*Vij’s</b> (1480 W. 11th just off Granville, 604.736.6664,
$$)–a unique dining experience in Vancouver, East Indian-Northwest fusion.
Vij does not take reservations, but he’ll feed you appetizers while you
stand in line. Lines start forming at 5:30;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>*Tojo’s</b> (777 W. Broadway, 604.872.8050, $$$)–the
best Japanese restaurant in Canada, no question;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Star Anise</b> (1485 W. 12th, 604.737.1485, $$$)–another
quality Asian-Northwest fusion restaurant.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b><u>Commercial Drive</u></b>: In many ways the most
interesting neighbourhood in Vancouver is Commercial Drive between 1st
and Broadway. Here one finds Italian coffee shops, aging hippies, a bit
of Vancouver’s gay scene and neo-retro-glam-funksters of the Gen Next generation,
all cheek by jowl. Plus you can take Vancouver’s otherwise useless SkyTrain
from downtown to the Drive!</font>
<p><font size=-1>On the Drive, you can hang at:</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>The WaaZuBee Caf&eacute;</b> (1622 Commercial Drive,
604.253.5299, $$)–if you are cool enough;</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Arriva</b> (1537 Commercial Drive, 604.251.1177, $$)–or
any of a number of other Italian restaurants.</font>
<p><b><font size=-1>Other Food Options</font></b>
<p><font size=-1><b>Asian</b>: Vancouver is a cosmopolitan Pacific Rim
city and there are excellent and inexpensive East Indian, Japanese, and
Chinese restaurants <i>everywhere</i>. Explore!</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Coffee shops</b>: This is what we are known for. Sadly,
we have become a Starbucks saturation zone, but you won’t be able to walk
for more than one block in any direction from anywhere without coming across
a decent cup of coffee. Use good sense and avoid chains!</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Fast food</b>: Canada has all the US favourites: McDonalds,
KFC, Burger King. If you are looking for the downmarket Canadian fast food
experience, try the <b>Red Robin</b> at 752 Thurlow, or, even better, follow
the philosophers of quantum gravity to <b>White Spot</b> at 580 W. Georgia.
A more upscale chain is <b>Earl’s</b> at 1185 Robson.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Bread and other bakery items</b>: Vancouver is blessed
with great bread. Try <u>Terra</u> breads at the <b>Granville Market</b>
and at the Yaletown Choices Market. Closer to the Hyatt, you can find <u>Ecco
Il Pane</u> breads in the<b> Market at The Bay</b> (the department store)
at the corner of Georgia and Granville—they make the world’s best raisin
bread, sweet, dense, and beautifully flavoured with caraway.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Pubs</b>: There are the standard nice but expensive
bars in all the downtown hotels. People in the know head directly for the
pub at the old<b> Sylvia Hotel</b> at Beach and Gilford on English Bay—somewhat
delapidated charm and the scene of many great moments in local history
and philosophy of science lore.</font>
<p><font size=-1><b>Canadian Cuisine</b>: What Canadian cuisine there is
tends to be Quebec cuisine, but there is no poutine (french fries with
gravy and cheese) that I can recommend in Vancouver. Something everyone
<i>should</i>
try however is the <u>Montreal bagel</u>—a smaller, slightly sweeter bagel
than those you find in New York, but a real bagel and worth trying. We
<i>do</i>
have a fair approximation of the Montreal bagel: It is available at <b>Siegel’s
Bagels</b> at 1883 Cornwall in Kitsilano. You can even get a sesame or
poppy seed bagel sandwich with Montreal smoked meat there and it is open
24 hours a day!</font>
<p><b><font size=-1>The Other Staples</font></b>
<p><font size=-1>Cigars: Yes, Cuban cigars are legal in Canada. You can
get them at any cigar shop in the city. Gastown seems to be the highest
density cigar area.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Booze: This is not a pleasant story. British Columbia
has dedicated liquor stores, and these are the <i>only</i> places one can
buy anything harder than wine and beer. The prices are not so great and
neither is the selection. Buy something at the duty-free on the way! If
you find yourself without a bottle of whisky, the nearest liquor stores
to the hotel are at 555 W. Hastings (in the Harbour Centre campus of Simon
Fraser University—the faculty, I believe, made this a bargaining demand
when the downtown campus was put in) and a rather better than usual one
at 1200 Alberni (about one block south and a few blocks west of the Hyatt).</font>
<p><font size=-1>Wine and Beer: There are some specialty shops that sell
wine and beer. These shops are allowed to be open even on Sunday! As far
as trying the local stuff goes, there are only two BC wines worth looking
out for: anything, but especially the Pinot Noir, from <u>Blue Mountain</u>,
and the <u>Mission Hill</u> <i>Reserve</i> Chardonnay. Everything else
is no better than average plonk. The beer situation is <i>much</i> better
and just about any local brew is worth drinking. Look out for local brews
from <u>Granville Island</u>, <u>Shaftebury</u>,<u> Russell’s</u>, <u>Bowen
Island</u>, etc. Stay away from anything brewed by Molson or Labatt’s no
matter how attractive the label is that they have slapped on it. Also,
avoid anything called Hemp Lager or Hemp Ale—these are beers that have
used hemp rather than hops in the brewing process. This is yet another
thing that hemp is <i>not</i> good for.</font>
